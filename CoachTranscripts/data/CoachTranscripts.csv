2016-06-12,"Mike Sullivan",TRUE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, you learn a lot. You learn a lot through the process. I think there's so many good people in this business, whether it's in coaching, players, management, scouting, there's so many good people that work extremely hard to be at their best. I'm grateful for the people that I've worked with throughout the years that have helped me become a better coach. I'm grateful for the opportunity to coach this group of players. COACH SULLIVAN: I think it places him up there with the greats of the game of all time. He's that good in my mind. I've said all along here through the course of the playoffs, he's deserving of the Conn Smythe. His numbers don't indicate the impact he had on helping this team win, or the impact he had on a game-to-game basis. He was a great leader for our team. It started by example with his performance and how he played. He's a complete player. He plays at both ends of the rink. He's a great faceoff guy. He kills penalties when we need him to. He plays in all the key situations. COACH SULLIVAN: I haven't had the opportunity to reflect on it, to be honest. I'm trying to enjoy the moment. I think when our guys were carrying the Stanley Cup around out there, what was going through my mind was, first and foremost, how proud I am of them for the sacrifices that they've made for us to win this championship. Then how grateful I am for the opportunity that I've been given to coach this team. When you ultimately win the championship, you reflect for a short period on the ice with the players, the one thing that jumps out at me is how hard it is to win. The San Jose Sharks are a great team. We have so much respect for how good they are. It's hard to win this. So couldn't be more proud of our players for the effort that they put in, the sacrifices that they made, the resilience and resolve they showed throughout the course of the second half of this season and throughout the post-season to win this championship. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, these guys have been receptive to our message from day one. As I've said to them all along, I know our team is going to score goals. In order to win championships, you got to keep it out of your net. You have to become a team that is stingy defensively. Everybody has to buy in to that idea for us to get to where we want to go. To their credit, they did, down to a man. When we started to get some traction towards the end of the post-season, we won a lot of games down the stretch, I think they really started to believe. That was the hard evidence that, Hey, if we play a certain way, we can be a good team and beat anybody in this league. I think that really helped us when we started this post-season as far as a belief in our identity and how we had to play, and also a certain belief in the group, that we have what it takes. That was the process we went through. We challenged these guys every day. I'm grateful that they responded the right way to how we challenged them. COACH SULLIVAN: The one thing we tried to do was create an identity and establish an identity. I thought as the head coach, it was my responsibility to direct that. So we look at our personnel. When we looked at the type of players we have, our core guys, we think we've got players that want to play fast. They can all really skate, when you look at Crosby and Malkin and Kessel and Letang, Hagelin we acquired down the stretch. Our core guys, they can all really skate. They want to play fast. They want to come through the neutral zone with speed. We tried to implement a game plan that allowed them to play to their strengths. So we tried to create an identity. When we go in and play a team, their coaches have a meeting before the game, what are they saying about the Pittsburgh Penguins? If 29 teams are saying the same thing, then we've created an identity. That's what we tried to do. And our players bought in. We felt as though, if we were a team that could play fast in every aspect of the game, that could be our competitive advantage on some of our opponents. I thought Jim Rutherford did a tremendous job in acquiring some guys along the way that enhanced that speed for us. So when we started to gain some traction down the stretch, that was the evidence that the players needed to get them to believe. Once we established that, I think they felt as though we had what it takes in our room. COACH SULLIVAN: Thank you."
2016-06-12,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: No, I don't think so. I think, listen, the stakes are high. This team really wants to win. When that happens, we're all human and we all have emotions. When I say the team was unsettled, by no means do I think we were flat. We certainly didn't have the start we wanted as far as controlling momentum right from the drop of the puck. Give San Jose credit, they were opportunistic on a couple of the chances they got and it ended up on the back of our net. I think we can play with more purpose in those first few shifts to get us off on the right foot in the first period. I know that our team is well aware that we need to have a better start to make sure that we don't get down in the game as early as we did. It's tough to win when you do that. I give our guys a lot of credit for fighting back right away and scoring two goals to get ourselves right back in the hockey game. COACH SULLIVAN: I think it's exciting. I think our guys are having fun with this whole journey that we've had. They're a close-knit group. They enjoy playing for each other. I think they're having fun with this. I think they're embracing the challenges we've been faced with to this point. We've got another great opportunity tonight. I think that's how we're all looking at it. We're excited to play. You know, it's hard to get to this point. The league is a very competitive league. There's a lot of really good teams. We beat some good teams to get here. COACH SULLIVAN: We're not worried about it, quite honestly. Both teams have to play on the same sheet. Depending on how it is, sometimes we have to simplify our game. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, Tanger is invaluable. He just plays so many important minutes for us, and so many minutes for us, in so many situations. He's an elite defenseman. I think he's one of the top defensemen in the league. He helps us get out of our end zone. He joins the rush. He runs our power play. He's in the penalty kill situations. I think his defensive play is underrated. His offensive play I think speaks for itself. You can see it in his numbers, in his performance. His play away from the puck, how he helps us defend in our end zone, kill penalties, play those kind of minutes for us, those are underrated by a lot of people. Certainly not by his coaching staff. But certainly he's a very important player for us. He's an elite defenseman. COACH SULLIVAN: Thank you."
2016-06-12,"Brian Dumoulin Ben Lovejoy",FALSE,"BEN LOVEJOY: Way better. I played two games in November that season. I was happy to be there. We lost them both. I had no impact on the Cup. I had a great seat to watch that team do it. BRIAN DUMOULIN: I think they started the game shooting the puck, whether it's from the point or off the wings. They dropped pucks from that area on, and that's what happens. A couple of them went in. It's a different game when that happens. BRIAN DUMOULIN: Can't share that with you now. Yeah, I play the same music pretty much. Come up with a playlist after you start winning. Guys start knowing the songs and the words. BRIAN DUMOULIN: I mean, a little bit. You can get caught up in the outside noise, especially in a game like that. I mean, they're a good team, too. They came out, pressured us hard. They had some good chances in the zone. They capitalized on them. I think they had five shots and scored on three of them. BEN LOVEJOY: I think the biggest part is staying out of the penalty box. They're lethal on that power play. They have so many guys that can beat you. We have to do our best to play an incredibly disciplined game. That's a game changer for them. BRIAN DUMOULIN: Not really, not yet. You're always thinking about it, kind of where you've come. You have to learn from the ups and downs of the season as you go on. BEN LOVEJOY: I think they'll deal (laughter). I grew up a sports fan. Brian grew up a sports fan. I couldn't tell you where the Patriots have won their last four. Nobody cares. Everybody is about getting it done. We would have loved to do it in Game5. But the Sharks are a good team. They're trying, too. We need to come out and play our best hockey tonight if we have any chance."
2016-06-12,"Peter DeBoer",TRUE,"COACH DeBOER: Well, I think first off, you have to give full credit to Pittsburgh. I thought they came out and played a hell of a series. They played their game for much longer stretches than we were able to. They dictated the play. They started quicker than us. That's the reason they're holding the Cup. COACH DeBOER: Their speed, the pressure they put on with their speed. It's not just their speed, they have good sticks, too. They force you into quicker decisions. They really challenge your execution. COACH DeBOER: I thought we had a shot. The first period, we had a couple two-on-ones, a couple guys in alone. Second period, I thought we had some really good stretches. That was our opportunity to maybe grab the lead. When we didn't, that was probably the difference in the game tonight. COACH DeBOER: Well, just raw. The end is like hitting a wall. You've been going since September. 106 games. How many hundreds of thousands of miles in the air. A special group. But only one team can win. That doesn't take anything away from what those guys accomplished. I don't think anyone should ever question the leadership or the character or the will of the group of men in there. I think it's been misplaced for a decade. I would hope they answered some questions. Let's be honest. Not many people have us making the playoffs. Not many people had us beating L.A. On and on. COACH DeBOER: Well, I don't know. I mean, obviously you'd like a Stanley Cup to show for it, but you don't have that. COACH DeBOER: You got all kinds of injuries, all kinds of things. I'm not going to give you the laundry list of that today. Trust me, there's a lot of guys playing in there with injuries. COACH DeBOER: Pavelski. Like I said, there's a laundry list of guys that have had things. We can talk about that at a later date. COACH DeBOER: Thank you."
2016-06-12,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: No more pressure. It was in the building last game. We can't win it tonight. It doesn't put any more pressure on us than we've had throughout the playoff. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, I mean, he is just one of the guys. You wouldn't know. There's no quirkiness to him. He doesn't seem to have any rituals, really highs and lows. He comes in, got a smile on his face. He does his job. You wouldn't know the bad days from the good days. I think that's the beauty of him. COACH DeBOER: I think being at home helped part of it. But I think it was more our mindset. We got away from it last game. We allowed them to funnel pucks to the net. That's what they do. I thought we did a great job, probably the best game of the series where we've done a good job of denying them funneling those pucks to the net. We've got to get back to that. We have to help Jonesy out. Even if those aren't quality shots, it creates action in our net, it creates some chaos. COACH DeBOER: As far as the forecheck and offensive zone time, I think it's been spurts, it hasn't been consistent enough for where we want it to be, expect it to be. You have to give them some credit for that. But we can also do a better job. I'm assuming tonight will be our best game in that department. As far as experience for the young guys, again, I think as a coach you don't really look at birth certificates. You look at guys that you think can help you win the game. COACH DeBOER: I think it's a couple things. I think obviously if you have the puck more, if you're attacking more, you're creating more of those opportunities. I don't think there's any doubt, too, that this time of year the teams get to play a little bit more. I think that's historically been the mindset. It's a little bit of both. Thank you."
2016-06-12,"Matt Cullen Patric Hornqvist",FALSE,"MATT CULLEN: I think it's been pretty consistent for us throughout the playoffs, really throughout the last stretch of the season. Our group is pretty consistent. We've done a pretty good job of pressuring teams, making life difficult as far as taking away time and space and using our feet to close on people. MATT CULLEN: Yeah, a little bit. It's come up quite a bit here throughout the playoffs. It's pretty amazing how things work out sometimes. Obviously this would have been the hope when I decided to come here. Realistically it's a very difficult road to climb. I feel really fortunate to be here, I really do. It's funny how things work out. MATT CULLEN: They have a lot of different weapons. I don't even know so much they adjustment as far as they move the puck around really well. They move it quick. They shoot it quick. It seems to me they put more pucks at the net, keep bodies closer to the net. I mean, that's kind of the fun part of the playoffs. There's a little bit of back and forth on adjustments. We look at a lot of what they're doing, study it pretty hard. But they're good, they have good personnel. It's a challenge for us each game. There's subtle little adjustments even from power play to power play."
2016-06-12,"Sidney Crosby",TRUE,"SIDNEY CROSBY: I wasn't really thinking about '09 that much. I was just thinking about how hard it was to get to this point, just trying to enjoy every second of it. It's not easy to get here. Having won seven years ago at a young age, you probably take it for granted a little bit. You don't think you do at the time, but it's not easy to get to this point. SIDNEY CROSBY: Well, obviously after a coaching change, I think everyone takes that personal, puts the responsibility on their shoulders to be better. I think individually and as a group we had high expectations, we knew we needed to be better. I thought we just slowly got better and better. Mike came in and made it pretty clear how he wanted us to play, what he expected from each individual guy. I think guys just welcomed the opportunity, welcomed the challenge, tried to get back on track. It took some time. Didn't happen overnight. But March was a big month for us. We knew we had to get a big push to get in the playoffs. We knew once you get in the playoffs, anything can happen. We were playing good at the right time. We had to go through some really good teams. Every team we played. New York was playing good down the stretch. Washington obviously, top team. Tampa had us on the brink of elimination. Then obviously San Jose, with the way they play, they're physical, fast. Jones was unbelievable through the whole series. SIDNEY CROSBY: I don't know. There are so many guys who contributed, to be honest. I look at this as a total team effort. I tried to work hard every night, do my job just like everyone else. SIDNEY CROSBY: When you have so much turnover the last couple years like we had, it's not easy to throw a bunch of guys together and develop that chemistry, that trust. It doesn't happen overnight. When you look at the group, how many new players we brought in, it was pretty special what we were able to do. We had a core that played together for a while, there was some trust there. When you look at all the guys we added, the young guys, the guys we added through trades, I think it takes a special group to be able to come together that quickly and build that trust basically along the way. SIDNEY CROSBY: There's so many different things that motivate you obviously to win, but there's other things. Daley had played for such a long time. Hadn't really even had a chance. He had been through some different playoffs, but getting hurt at the time he did, knowing how important it was, he had told me that he went and seen his mom in between series and stuff, she wasn't doing well, she wanted to see him with the Cup. That was important to her. I think that kind of stuck with me after he told me that. We were motivated to get it for him, even though he had to watch. Duper, obviously what he's been through the last couple years, the type of teammate he's been, just the way he's approached everything. I think he would have loved to have been playing. This is as good as we could have done without him playing. That was special. And Flower, the teammate he's been, it hasn't been easy getting hurt like he did. Having come in and played the way he did, he just handled it better than you'd expect. SIDNEY CROSBY: I don't know. I think the best way I can describe it is, like I said, I have a greater appreciation this time around. At a young age, going back-to-back like we did, you just think it's going to be an annual thing. With the core we have, you think everyone's going to stay together, the team's not going to change. But it does. That's kind of the reality of playing hockey. There's turnover, things change, guys move on, different coaches. There's so much change. SIDNEY CROSBY: It didn't really change. I felt like every night as a line we wanted to produce and create things offensively. In the playoffs, it's tight. There's not a lot of chances to be had. When there isn't, you can't be one-dimensional. You have to make sure you're contributing other ways. Whether that is creating momentum, drawing penalties, winning faceoffs, everything that it takes, all those little details go a long way. There's more to just winning games than scoring goals. It feels great, it's important. That's what our job is. But there's a lot of other things that go into it. SIDNEY CROSBY: I think with Cully, he brings a lot of leadership, a lot of experience. To play the role he did at his age, I think everyone is tired at this point, he was playing a lot of important minutes for us, defensive zone faceoffs, penalty kill. He was doing a lot of things for us. He was scoring some big goals. He had some huge goals throughout the playoffs. He just brought a lot of leadership. With so many new guys, it's nice to have someone come in like that that takes it upon himself right away. He didn't kind of wait to feel comfortable. You could tell he was comfortable right away. That goes a long way. With Jim, I think the biggest thing I can say is he had an idea of what he wanted us to play like, what he saw our team as, our identity, if we wanted to win. He put the guys in place to be able to play that way. SIDNEY CROSBY: I think March. We needed to win some big games in March against some really good teams. It wasn't like we had one of those games, then a week where we didn't have big ones. I mean, it felt like every single game was huge and against a team we're competing for in a playoff spot. When you beat good teams, you do it consistently over the course of a month, at that time of the year when you know everybody is at their best, that builds a lot of confidence in your group. You're playing the right way. You're playing desperate at a time when you need to be. Going into the playoffs, there was no letdown. We just carried that mentality right into the playoffs. That's probably the best thing that could have happened to us. SIDNEY CROSBY: Thanks, guys."
2016-06-11,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: We really liked a lot of our game. We carried the play for long stretches. Our power play was good. A lot of the aspects of our game we really liked. COACH SULLIVAN: I think we respond the right way to adversity, the ebbs and flows. Obviously we didn't get the result the last game. This is as high stakes as it gets. Our players are well aware of the situation. I think throughout the course of this post-season, this group of players has shown an ability to respond the right way. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think he has a quiet confidence about him. I think he believes in himself. He knows he's a good goalie. He has shown a maturity level beyond his years in a lot of ways. But probably the most impressive way is just his ability to deal with any of the adversity that he faces along the way. If one goes in that he thinks he should have had, he has the ability to stay in the moment, try to make the next save. He's a real competitor. We love that about him. We love his makeup. For him to show that type of an attribute at such a young age, it usually takes players a few years to acquire that type of mental toughness where your confidence doesn't get shaken or your performance doesn't get influenced by some of the adversity that you go through throughout the course of a game or from game to game. COACH SULLIVAN: Certainly with Matt, he's a pretty composed kid. What I've really grown to admire about him is just his professionalism. He comes to the rink, he controls what he can, he works hard every day, he prepares the right way. There isn't a whole lot of drama surrounding him. He just comes to the rink and works. When you have players like that, that come to the rink and just work to get better each and every day, as a coaching staff I think it makes our jobs a lot easier because of the approach that they take, players like Matt. We've got a fair amount of them on our team. I have to say this group of players has been a privilege to coach because of their professionalism and their work ethic and how they approach their jobs every day. Matt is one of those guys. He comes to the rink every day, tries to get better. Doesn't really get on an emotional rollercoaster, so to speak. He just controls what he can. I think that's one of the reasons why he has the ability to endure some of the challenges that this league presents. I think one of the things that young players have to learn when they establish themselves in this league is how to handle the emotions associated with wins and losses, highs and lows, when you're feeling really confident, when maybe your confidence gets shaken and how do you get it back. Those are all human emotions that players, athletes, have to deal with. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, we'd like to win the next game, regardless of where it's being played. I think being on the road, it's just the team. There are less distractions for sure. But having said that, I thought our guys did a really good job of handling it the right way. It was unfortunate that we didn't get the result we were looking for. But we're playing a very good opponent and we know that. We know this is the most difficult win to get. Our players are well aware of the expectations and the heightened intensity that we need to have in order to get this next win. So regardless of where it is, our focus is on that. Thank you."
2016-06-11,"Jim Rutherford",FALSE,"JIM RUTHERFORD: That was an exciting time. Of course, your first year in the league is exciting enough. When you enter that room with such a great player like him, it was special. But he was a guy that in some ways was hard to describe. He just had a special way about him. As a teammate, you looked around the room, if somebody was struggling with something, in his own way he'd go by and say something to them. Might not be long. Might not say, Hey, do you want to go somewhere and talk? He'd walk by and kind of catch you from behind, give you a little poke, a little elbow, say a few words, which meant a lot. JIM RUTHERFORD: Yeah, he wasn't still there in Hartford when I got there. I mean, when you're the player that he is, one of the top players of all time, he obviously did so many things for the game. But he played the game in a way like really no other superstar played it. He could play in all situations, in all types of games, whether it was the physical game or finesse game. He could win games in so many different ways. JIM RUTHERFORD: I don't think there is one. He was a guy that could win a scoring race. He was a guy who could win the fight. He could do everything. Some of the power forwards now can do some of those things, but not at the level he did. JIM RUTHERFORD: I don't know. I guess the one that I remember the most, my grandfather had passed away when I was playing for the Wings. It was after he had finished playing there, but he was still in the organization. The organization didn't want to give me the time off to go home to the funeral. I made my own decision that I was going to go. He was the first one there to tell me. He come up to me, like I was saying before, comes from the side or behind, gives you a little elbow, Hey, kid, good for you, that's exactly what you should have done. He was right there to support me. But I can tell you there were other situations where times were tough with the team. My first game in Maple Leaf Gardens, I grew up north of Toronto, so that's what a kid looks forward to. I got pulled after the first period. Gave up three goals. We were losing 3-0. Again, he was the first guy in between periods to come over and say, It's okay. JIM RUTHERFORD: Well, it wasn't fun. I didn't like practice to start with. Certainly didn't like it with the guys that could really shoot it. In those days, we used wrist shots probably as much as we use slapshots now. He had a very, very heavy shot. He practiced the way he played games. He played for keeps. He was trying to score all the time. It was a hard, heavy shot. JIM RUTHERFORD: I'm hoping to. We'll have to see how the schedule plays out. Thank you."
2016-06-11,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Well, huge. I think when he went down, we were 4-0. We had a great start to the season. We felt guys were slotted in the right spot. It was a catastrophic injury, it really was. There was talk at some points there he might miss up to six months. I think it was a blessing in disguise looking back at it now because it forced me to get to know the organization top to bottom. We tried a lot of young guys in different spots. Hertl played some center. We brought guys in. Tierney had a chance to play. It was a quick learn for me on the depth of the organization. Got to know the young guys, know what they could do, what they couldn't do. COACH DeBOER: Inspirational speeches? Been a long time. We've got a veteran group. I don't see my job as going in there. These guys don't need to be inspired to play. They're in the Stanley Cup Finals. Some of them have waited 18 years. There's no speech I'm going to give Patty Marleau and understand the situation and make him play harder. That's for movies and Sunday football, for sure, when you're playing 11 or 12 games a year. COACH DeBOER: I think special teams. It goes in waves. I think we haven't had as many opportunities as we have some other series. You don't get in that rhythm when you go long stretches without one and then get one. It's hard to get in that mindset. We got to keep moving our feet, keep trying to draw penalties. I think there's penalties out there. They're letting the teams play. So we've got to attack more holes, you know, find a way to draw some more penalties to get in our rhythm. Just feeling confident in creating offense. I think with some of the injuries we've dealt with, he's playing higher in the lineup. He gets maybe some more offensive looks. COACH DeBOER: He was a big part of it. We really liked our team coming out of training camp. We went into L.A., won the first game of the season. Went into Anaheim, won. With the guys slotted in the spots they were in to start the season, I thought we had the potential to be 105- to 110-point team. When he goes down, definitely that changes. That's not the only thing. He comes back. We got a real good handle on the depth of the organization, which allowed Doug to make some real good acquisitions to fill some of the holes that we realized we had. I think if that doesn't happen, like I told Pierre, sometimes you go into the deadline and you say, We've got this young guy here, he can do that job. Well, we tried every young guy in every spot the first half of the year because of that injury. We had a real good handle on who could do what. I think that led to the acquisitions. COACH DeBOER: I think he definitely has embraced it. I think he's earned it. I think when I got here, probably the toughest job I had was sorting out the leadership. There's so many quality people here. The guys not wearing letters right now are Vlasic, Marleau, Burns. You got guys, Joel Ward. We've been inclusive in making sure that every leadership meeting we have, that group is much bigger than guys that wear the letters. COACH DeBOER: Well, sure, I mean, you look at the record, it's hard to explain. I don't know. Part of the explanation is those Western Division teams, Conference teams you're talking about are pretty good teams. They might beat teams even worse if they didn't travel as much. I don't know the answer to that. I can tell you, if you ask me if I want to fly back and forth across the country as much as we have, or if we can sit at home and play in a division like Pittsburgh plays in, I think everyone would line up for the Pittsburgh schedule. The one thing is, we have a resilient group. We're comfortable on the road. The amazing part to me is the group has never used that as an excuse. Never once have I heard about travel or weariness or, We don't want to practice today. It's been the opposite. I've had to stop them from working. COACH DeBOER: I mean, coaching in the east, not watching them play, you fall victim to what you guys write and say about them, which is they can't get it done, there's not enough character, there's not enough leadership. That's what people think. It's so far off base. There's just no substance to that at all. I think these guys have proven it this year. But I saw that in training camp. You can't help but come in with some of those preconceived notions that you've been reading for a decade. They quickly put that to rest. It's some of the best leadership and some of the most honest people I've ever worked with. So while it hasn't surprised me, it's definitely something that I've learned. COACH DeBOER: One of the greatest leaders I've been around, hands down. I'm not talking just teams I've coached in the regular season in the NHL. I've coached World Championships and World Junior teams. He's an unbelievable combination of professionalism, work ethic, and a great casual, relaxed way around the dressing room where he makes everybody feel included. This guy is a fantastic leader. Thank you."
2016-06-10,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I'm sure Matt will respond fine. He's done it all year long. He's a real good goalie. One of the things we love about him is his demeanor. He really has a calming influence on the group. COACH SULLIVAN: Yeah, I thought last night was one of our best nights as far as the impact the power play had. Even when it didn't score, it certainly had a lot of zone time, a lot of scoring chances. I thought the execution was really sharp. What I really liked about it was the puck movement was quick, it was sharp, it was on the tape. When they move the puck like that, they're very difficult to defend against because it turns the penalty kill unit into a reactive mode. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think it wasn't like they stormed us by any stretch. For long stretches of the game, I really liked our team, I really liked our performance. I thought the beginning of the game, they were opportunistic on the few opportunities they got a few minutes into the game. But I thought our team responded the right way. We scored two quick goals to get right back in the hockey game. So we settled into it fairly quickly. I don't think it was a case we got caught off guard. We knew exactly what to expect going into it. Obviously from a goal-scoring standpoint, it wasn't what we hoped for in the start of the game, but certainly I loved the way our guys responded to get right back into the hockey game and make it 2-2 right away with so much hockey to play. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, he's such an important player for us. I think he did have a strong game last night. I think he's had a strong series. Horny is a guy that plays extremely hard. He plays in the battle areas. He goes to the net. He makes it really difficult for his opponents. He's an invaluable player for us. He plays in front of the net on the power play. Obviously he's played with Sid here for quite some time now. That's been such a great line for us. He's a real important player for us. The thing I love the most about him is I love his energy, I love the passion he brings to the game. He wears his emotions right on his sleeve. I think his energy is contagious on our bench."
2016-06-10,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Yeah, I think great players have that ability. I put him in that category, just like Joe Pavelski has a knack for game-winning goals. I think Logan has the ability to raise his level of play when the chips are down. I think he's done that for us the entire playoffs. COACH DeBOER: I thought that was our best line last night. Melker has been excellent the entire playoff, but particularly in the Final, I think he's really found another level for us here. He's disruptive on the forecheck, has tenacity on the puck, he's turning a lot of pucks over. COACH DeBOER: Well, I think the one thing is we're 105 games into this season. You got to win all kinds of different ways. Some nights it's your special teams, some nights is five-on-five, some nights is your goalie. We make no apology for how a game looks. COACH DeBOER: I think the nice thing is we're at home. The fact we have two days to prepare I think helps us, especially with the travel we've done as a team this year. COACH DeBOER: Tragic day. To think that we lost Muhammad Ali and Gordie Howe in the same week or 10-day span is incredible. You talk about two guys that were torchbearers for their sport over the last century, that would be the name for hockey and the name for boxing. COACH DeBOER: I think so, for sure. I think goal-scorers, a lot of it's confidence and feeling good about yourself. I think a lot of times it's a bounce or one to go in off your shin pad or an empty netter that gets you going in the right direction. COACH DeBOER: Well, they've got a good power play like we've got a good power play. I think our penalty killing has to be a little tighter. We were very good early in the series. I thought last night we were a little off, a lot like our defensive game in our own end a little bit. We have to tighten both those things up. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, if he doesn't have that performance, we're not playing another game. I think he recognized the importance of the situation, you know, stood up and was our best player. COACH DeBOER: Well, no. I think it goes to show what the shot stat significance is, at least in our minds. I've said this before earlier in the series: I don't think it's always an accurate reflection of the game. COACH DeBOER: Tomas Hertl is day-to-day. I haven't been to the rink yet today. I don't know if he was on the ice or not. I don't have that report yet."
2016-06-09,"Mike Sullivan",TRUE,"COACH SULLIVAN: No, I thought we did all of the above. I thought we had traffic at the net. We had pucks to the net. There were people there. We had rebound opportunities. We couldn't seem to find that third goal. COACH SULLIVAN: No. I thought our team as a whole was a little bit unsettled at the first part of the game, but we settled in fast. Obviously we didn't have the start that we would have liked. But I really liked the fact that we battled back as quick as we did, making it a 2-2 game right away. The reality is there's a lot of hockey left at that point to be played. COACH SULLIVAN: I thought they handled it fine. When you look at how the game was played, there's a lot of things to like about how we played. I loved our energy. I thought we were on the puck. I thought we were fast. I thought we controlled territory. I thought we controlled the scoring chances, the shot clock. There are a lot of things that I think we can build on. We knew it wasn't going to be easy. These are two really good teams playing against one another. The elimination game is always the most difficult. We knew it going in. We knew we were going to have to bring our best. COACH SULLIVAN: That's how they generate their offense. They have big, strong bodies. I thought for the most part we did a pretty good job. It's not like we gave up a lot of scoring chances. They're a very good team. They have good players. I think that's one of their strengths, that's where they have the opportunity to use their size and their skill level. COACH SULLIVAN: No, Burns is in the rush all the time. That's part of what he brings to their team. He's a very good player. He has the ability to generate offense from the blueline. I just think that's part of their identity. That's part of his identity as a player. We certainly have to be aware of him when he's on the ice. Like I said, I thought as a group, for the most part, there's a lot of this game that we really liked. Thanks."
2016-06-09,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: I think our players have this game in perspective. We spoke about it the last couple of days. I trust our leadership, as I said yesterday. I think we're at our best when we play with emotion and play with energy, but it certainly has to be controlled emotion and it has to be channeled the right way. COACH SULLIVAN: I think Sid has been a force every game. He may not have scored, but he certainly is a handful out there regardless of who they put out on the ice against him. We'll look for certain matchups. It's easier to get at home. From the standpoint of a defense pair, it's usually easier to get a defense pair match than it is to get a forward line match. COACH SULLIVAN: I think Sergei, he's been terrific. He has a nice demeanor about him. He has a great relationship with our defense core. I think he offers them a lot of subtle insights into how to be a more effective player. He's certainly a guy they have a tremendous amount of respect for because of what he's accomplished in the game. I think the fact that he's so close to having played with a lot of these guys, they can certainly relate to him because it hasn't been too long since he hasn't been in the heat of the battle himself. COACH SULLIVAN: No, I'm not really a superstitious guy. I believe in controlling what we can, making sure that we channel our thoughts the right way, and leaving it all out there. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, as I just said, obviously the stakes are high. They have been for a long time now for our team. I think the challenge is the discipline of staying in the moment and just not getting ahead of yourself. We've talked a lot about that with our team over the course of this post-season. I think our guys have done a terrific job in that regard. Just focusing on the one task at hand. We know we have work ahead of us here to accomplish what we set out to do. The best way, the most effective way to do it, is to rely on your daily routine, your game day routine, you make sure you stay in the moment and you don't get ahead of yourself. COACH SULLIVAN: Geno is an elite player. When he plays like he did in the last game, I think it just makes us that much more difficult to play against. It's one more real threat out there that our opponents have to be concerned about. As I've said all along here, Geno scored for us the last game, which is great for him and great for our team. We're a better team when he does, for sure. But he certainly has had an impact on this series other than just the score sheet. The first few games, I see his game getting better and better at both ends of the rink. That's our expectation. That's our expectation of him. That's our expectation of our top people, that they have that kind of an impact on the game. COACH SULLIVAN: I think Matt's game on the ice speaks for itself, the impact he has there. He's a terrific player. We use him in so many important situations. I don't think I have to speak to his performance on the ice because everybody sees it. I have a tremendous amount of respect for Matt as a person, how he's able to have an impact on our locker room and on the bench. He's a guy that's played a long time. He's accomplished a lot in this game. I think he brings a certain experience level, a certain perspective having gone through so many different experiences as a player. Just his ability to share that with the players in the locker room I think has been invaluable for our team. COACH SULLIVAN: I think if that's something he'd like to do, for sure."
2016-06-09,"Peter DeBoer",TRUE,"COACH DeBOER: Excellent. Both of them were excellent. We needed some big-game performances from guys. Jonesy was one of those guys in a tough environment. I thought we got big games from some other people, too. COACH DeBOER: I think Burnsy brings the same energy every night. It's not realistic he's going to score every night. I think he consistently tries to be a difference maker in every game he plays. That's the beauty of him. Tonight that was a huge goal for us. We've been talking about getting the first goal. It was big to get it. We took a couple penalties in the first, which kind of took the momentum away. They obviously scored on one of them. COACH DeBOER: I spent a month with him at the World Championships. He backed up Mike Smith last year. We won a gold medal. Mostly practice. He played one game. I got to know him as a person, being around that team. I think right away you recognized his composure, how calm and cool he was even in that situation. Then the big question was whether there was a competitive edge there with that composure. That's always the million-dollar question. COACH DeBOER: Not really. Just stick with it. One we stuck in our own net off a deflection. The other one went in off Hagelin as he came across the front. Two kind of seeing-eye goals. It was critical at that point our group recognize we were doing some good things and stick with it. Again, the penalties kind of took the momentum away from us. Again, we regrouped and found a way. COACH DeBOER: Thank you."
2016-06-09,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Just our response. I think anytime you get in a situation when your back's against the wall, you always wonder what the response of your group is going to be. That for me said a lot about our group. COACH DeBOER: No, definitely I think it can. I think definitely a goal. I mean, we talked about scoring first. If we don't, we can't just back the bus up and head home. We want to play with a lead and put them in a position where they're playing from behind. We haven't done that yet. So that's the goal. COACH DeBOER: I think our group's whole motivation is to make all you guys get back on a plane and go back to San Jose again. That's everybody's goal. I know it's mine (laughter). Actually, the pressure gets lifted in situations like this a little bit. We know the spot we're in. We know what everybody is saying. We just got to go out there and play our best game. I know we'll do that. Thank you."
2016-06-09,"Brent Burns Logan Couture Martin Jones",TRUE,"BRENT BURNS: Did you ask if I was comfortable pinching? It was a good forecheck by Karly. Just tried to help him out. I think there was a change. LOGAN COUTURE: Yeah, he was great. He made some big-time saves. He's been playing like this for a long time, regular season, playoffs. A lot of people unfortunately don't get to see him, us being on the West Coast. BRENT BURNS: Just kind of developed. The game was pretty tight. I think it's a pretty hard-checking, tight game. Yeah, just normal game. LOGAN COUTURE: When he's jumping in the rush, it adds a different dimension to our team. Obviously everyone knows he's got the shot. When he reads plays, he's able to pinch, use his big body to protect pucks, score goals. He made a couple nice looks. One he saw me for a high tip. LOGAN COUTURE: To be honest, nothing changed. The biggest thing with our group in this playoffs and this season compared to years past is the composure, the calmness that we feel. LOGAN COUTURE: Yeah, I want to try to produce every night. That's my goal when I come to the rink, help the team try to score a goal. I'm sure if you ask Pav, Jumbo, Burnsy Paddy, everyone, even Tommy Wingels, Zuby, they all want to score, they want to help our team. MARTIN JONES: Yeah, always have a chance. BRENT BURNS: I think the extra day, you have to take advantage of it, for both teams. Probably better for their team. We're used to the travel. MARTIN JONES: We're pretty different goaltenders. But just watching him, how he competes, he's one of the best playoff goalies around. BRENT BURNS: I think every game has been really close. Just a bounce here or there. They're all going to be tight. Going forward, it's going to be the same thing. It's a matter of just trying to work for that balance. It's been going their way. They've had good starts. I think obviously we've been fighting to get back in the games. We've done that. They just seem to get that extra one. Tight games. They're good. We're good. It's going to be tight."
2016-06-08,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Very valuable. They've been very valuable. I think all of our lines have a little bit of a different identity that make up what our group has become. We try to use them in situations that play to their strengths. Our fourth line plays a lot of hard minutes for us, difficult minutes. They get a lot of defensive zone faceoff responsibilities where they're forced to have to defend if they don't win the faceoff. COACH SULLIVAN: It's a little bit of both. We worked on things out there today that we think will help us in the next game. That's been our approach all year, is we're trying to get better every day when we come to the rink. That's what we tried to do today. We tried to get better out there today. We watched some film. We saw some areas where we think we can improve to help our chances to win in the next game. We worked on some of those areas on the ice today. That's the process this team has gone through since I've been here. We'll continue to go through that process. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think you know you're going to get your opponent's very best. We know that. We're going to have to have our very best in order to get the result that we want. Our players are well aware of that. Our focus is on that one game in front of us. We've been through a few of those elimination experiences already this season. We have that experience to draw on. I think our players are well aware of what to expect as far as how that game is going to be played, the urgency, the intensity, the focus, the determination that it's going to take in order for us to win. COACH SULLIVAN: Our young defensemen like to play with Ben because he's very vocal, he helps his partner a lot with how he communicates. He's very encouraging on the bench. He's a real positive guy. I know whoever plays with him respects that about Ben. He's one of those guys, when you're his partner, they know that Ben has their back. So regardless of who we put him with, when we put Olli back in the lineup, we thought Ben might have an opportunity to help Olli simplify his game, communicate with him. COACH SULLIVAN: No. I don't think it's necessary. We all set out in training camp to accomplish a certain goal. I think that goal is obvious. The most effective way to get there is to make sure that our focus is on the task at hand. That's the process that we talk about every day. That's what we talk to our players about. I think our guys have done a great job as far as staying in the moment, not getting ahead of themselves, not dwelling on the past, but just staying in the moment and staying on task. COACH SULLIVAN: I really don't have a reaction. My focus is on trying to win a game. I'm trying to help our players in every way that we can as a coaching staff so that they can be at their best. COACH SULLIVAN: The way I look at it, this is the players' game. The players are the guys that get it done. They deserve the credit. These guys have played extremely hard. They've made the sacrifices that are necessary in order for us to be in a position where we are. That is how we look at it. We put ourselves in a position to have a great opportunity. Now it's our job to take advantage of it. But our players deserve all the credit for bringing us to where we are right now. They're the guys that go through the process every day. They make the necessary sacrifices on the ice in order to help our team win. COACH SULLIVAN: Thank you."
2016-06-08,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Well, I think we did a better job, better sticks. Jumped to check in D zone coverage. I think early in the series, we were just giving them a little bit too much room. They slung a lot of pucks to the net. COACH DeBOER: Well, I think the results are closer than it feels right now, I really do. We had some good looks. They've all been one-goal games, or late-in-the-game losses. I think it's closer than it feels and we've got to give ourselves an opportunity that if they stumble, we're going to jump on it. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, I mean, this group is like that every day all year. I'm glad that I saw that today. You're never sure, considering the circumstances. I would have been worried had they come in quiet or dragging a little bit. COACH DeBOER: I think every experience is important. I think the message out of that experience is they've been where Pittsburgh is sitting right now, saw how quickly that can turn if you lose a game or the momentum swings the other way. It can happen to anybody. COACH DeBOER: I don't think so. When you know Pav, he's going to take that responsibility on himself regardless of whether he's got a letter on or not. I think he has for more than this year, he's done it over the last four or five years for San Jose. That's just the kind of guy he is. He feels he can be the difference in a game. He has been for us. We wouldn't be here without what he's done through the first three rounds. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, sure. We have been. We were the best road team in the league. We know that. I think we're confident on the road. This isn't easy. It's a really hard thing to do. It's going to be hard for them to close us out. It's going to be hard for us to show up here tomorrow and win a game in this environment. I think our guys are up for some heavy lifting. We feel we can get it done. COACH DeBOER: Thank you."
2016-06-07,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: No. I give our players a lot of credit. We believe in these guys. That's what I've said all along throughout the course of this post-season. Every player goes through their ups and downs, times when they're at the top of their game, and times where it can be a bit of a challenge. I think that's just human nature. Our players are no different. COACH SULLIVAN: I think when you're a young player, you're trying to make your way into the NHL, you're excited to be there. My recollection of the opportunity that San Jose gave me to potentially play for their NHL team, I was excited about it. It was an exciting time for the San Jose Sharks, being a new team in the league. To be one of those players on the ground floor, to try to help build something that would hopefully be a long-lasting legacy for the San Jose Sharks, for me was exciting. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think I trust our leadership. We've got some guys in there that have this in perspective, that have been through similar experiences in the past. I think our guys are very grounded. They understand the challenge in front of us. We just have to focus on that one game, and we've got to bring our very best for that one game. That's all that we can control. We have to try to do our best to ignore some of the noise surrounding the group. I think our players are well aware of it. They've been through it the whole post-season. We've been through it a number of elimination games already. They've handled themselves the right way. Our players are well aware, just based on their comments after the game last night, excited to be in the position we're in, but by no means do we think that we've accomplished what we've set out to do. We still have a lot of work ahead of us. Our players are well aware of that. COACH SULLIVAN: Yeah, it is. I think one of the things we've challenged our group with all year is just to try to stay in the moment and not get ahead of ourselves and look beyond the task at hand. But also not dwell on the past. We try to take lessons from our experiences in the past, whether they be positive or negative. Certainly the most important game is the one right in front of us. That's where we have to have our focus. We need to have that laser focus for that one task at hand. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think they've been an underestimated group all throughout the post-season. These guys are playing extremely hard. They play the game the right way. I think they pride themselves on the contributions they make to our team. I think they believe in our team. I think because of that, it's a team defense, not necessarily a group of individuals out there. I think that's what's helped each player throughout the course of this post-season. They trust one another. They rely on one another. They support one another. Because of that, I think they bring out the best in each other. We've certainly challenged these guys each and every day to be at their best. What I like about this group, and what I've really grown to admire about this group, is how close-knit they've become through this journey. I think they really established a trust factor amongst each other that they're going to do their jobs. COACH SULLIVAN: No, there hasn't been. He's been a consistent performer for us, not just through the playoffs, but down through the end of the regular season when we were battling to put ourselves in a position for the playoffs. Phil has been a huge part of this team's success in his contributions that he's made both offensively and defensively. He's part of a line with Bones and Haggy that has been a lot to handle for our opponents. I think they've scored timely goals for us. They've defended extremely hard when they played against opponent's top players. I give Phil a lot of credit. I think his game has evolved into a complete two-way game. We've asked him to improve in certain areas of his game away from the puck, in the battle areas, and he's embraced our message. He's been very receptive. I think he's really gained a whole lot of admiration from his coaching staff and his teammates with how his game has evolved here in the second half of the season."
2016-06-07,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Well, I don't know if switching the lines up is the answer to getting the lead. We've shortened the bench the last two games because we've been behind. It's not ideal. Catches up to you, especially when you're this deep into the playoffs and have played as many games as we have and logged as many miles as we have. It's been more out of necessity. COACH DeBOER: Well, I think you hit it right on the head. It's one game. We want to win one game and get a Game 6 back here at home. I think we would be comfortable in that spot that we could get it to go seven. Short-term we've got to go in and win one road game. We've been the best road team in the league all year. It's not going to be easy. Yeah, I think our game has grown through the series. We cleaned some things up. We limited their shots last game from earlier in the series. I thought every game we've created a little bit more chances to score. I think our big guys have gotten more shots off and more looks as the series has gone on. We're doing some good stuff. COACH DeBOER: I liked our start. I liked our first 10 minutes. Thought we got off and got going. We had a couple good looks early, Thornton and Pavelski had a two-on-one early, Murray made a save. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, you know, I mean, that's easy to say. I've said all along, there's another team playing with the same level of desperation, too. You're not going to get 60 minutes of that. I liked our start. I thought we sagged after they scored a little bit, which is natural, especially after the second goal. We found a way to get it back in the third, get going in the right direction. They're also sitting on a lead, so they're sitting back a little bit. There's a lot of factors that play into it a little bit. COACH DeBOER: That's a good question. I don't know. I mean, that's a reality of what we deal with. The one thing about the guys here is they've never used it as an excuse. You never hear that as an excuse. Coming out here as a first-year coach, I thought I would hear that from these guys. I think they've been doing it for so long, it's a part of life and playing out here. They refuse to use it as an excuse. So I'm not going to. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, I mean, I remember with the Devils, we were in a 3-0 hole, which is a worse situation. Everyone was writing us off. We took the approach of, Why not us? I don't care what the record book says, that only one or two teams have come back from this situation, whatever those numbers are. Why can't we be the first team to do it? COACH DeBOER: I don't know. I mean, that's the million-dollar question. We've got to find out. I don't believe it's gripping their sticks too tight. I think you have to give some credit to Pittsburgh. I think their goalie has made some big saves at key times on some of those looks. COACH DeBOER: Well, I mean, they get back quickly. They just get the puck out of their own end as quickly as possible up to their forwards. There's nothing fancy about it. Not afraid to rim it, to throw it out, to flip it out. They're not looking to make cute plays. They're just looking to get it out of their own zone as quickly as possible. You've got to have a combination of aggressiveness and patience when you're playing a team like that. It can get frustrating at some points because you work hard to get in there, you know, they're just throwing it out past you again. COACH DeBOER: Improvement every day that I've seen him. Hopeful, yes. I term him as day-to-day. COACH DeBOER: Well, I think they had some good looks last night. I thought every game they've found a way to create a little bit more. But, you know, there is no magic answer. They get a ton of attention. I think our support group has to take a little bit of pressure off them. We got a goal from Melker Karlsson last night. We got to find a way to get some from some other people, too. We've got to draw a few more power plays, which usually creates some offense for those guys. There's some things we can do. But I can tell you their effort, the things that they've done that have made them successful through the first three rounds of the playoffs haven't changed going into this round. You have to give Pittsburgh some credit for the job they've done on them. The stars on both sides would tell you there's not a lot of room out there."
2016-06-06,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: I think it's just there are good teams, there are good teams left. Both teams are trying to win. Both teams have good players. The margin for error is small. There's been a lot of one-goal games. We've had a few instances where teams have come back just with bizarre circumstances. For example, the three pucks over the glass, that's a tough one. But I still like the way our team's playing. I think we play the game the right way. I still think we play on our toes. We're still on the attack. I don't see us falling into the trap of playing in a defensive shell, which is usually when you allow teams to rally against you. I've always been a strong believer that the minute your team stops trying to score goals, your mindset changes, and so does your opponent's. We've always been a team that's encouraged our guys to continue to try to score goals when we have a lead. We just have to do it the right way. COACH SULLIVAN: I'm not sure when he means by 'loose'. I think there are areas of our game where we can certainly be better, where we have been better the first part of the series. I don't think by any means were we bad. It was a pretty even game. It's two pretty good teams that are trying to win. You have to give San Jose credit. They pushed hard. They're a good team. I think when we're at our best, we get back the pucks quickly and we use our mobility and our stick skills to come out of our end zone efficiently. When we do that, I think it sets up our overall game. COACH SULLIVAN: My reaction is that Geno really wants to help this team win. That's how he feels his contribution to helping us win, that's how it takes place. Even though he hasn't scored in this series, he still has an impact on the game. I've said this all throughout the playoffs, with our top players, of course we'd like them to score, and when they score, it certainly improves our chances of winning games. But when they don't score, they still have an impact on the game. Those are the discussions that we've had with Geno and Sid and players of that type, where as long as we're playing the game the right way, we're taking what the game gives us, we don't become a high-risk team, because we're forcing plays to try to score that aren't necessarily there. If we play the game the right way, they'll score. I believe that. COACH SULLIVAN: When we get hemmed in in our end zone, it doesn't fall on any two players. There's five guys on the ice out there that have to work together to try to get out of our end zone. I don't know that it falls on any two players. There are instances where we had extended zone time. There were instances where San Jose had extended zone time. The zone time, as far as offensive zone and defensive zone, was almost 50%. That's an indication of how the game was being played. It was a pretty even game. Certainly when we're trying to work together as a group to exit out of our end zone, we have exit strategies and release points and support mechanisms built in place that we try to help our guys with puck support so that we can get out of our end zone if and when we do get hemmed in there. I don't think it's anything we have to overthink. I think it's a combination of us just playing with a little bit more heightened intensity, and maybe simplifying the game a little bit. COACH SULLIVAN: From a chance standpoint, the chances were fairly even. We try to look at statistics and put them in their proper context, that gives us an indication of how we think the game is played. If anything, it gives us, or provides affirmation, that what we see is actually what we see. I think sometimes you can get fooled by certain statistics if you look at them in isolation. So we never look at any one statistic in isolation and try to draw a conclusion because I think it's dangerous, especially when you don't apply the proper context. The scoring chances were fairly even in the last game. The first two games, we controlled the scoring chances. We've controlled the shot clock in all of the games. But I don't think in the last game the shot clock was an indication of how the game was being played. I think it was a more even game than the shot clock indicated. That's what we told our players. COACH SULLIVAN: Not only are they very popular players in Sweden, they're very popular players in Pittsburgh, as well. We're thrilled with how they're playing for our team. They're both terrific players in their own right. They're different in how they play. But what they bring to our team, they certainly make us a better team. Haggy is a guy that brings tremendous speed. His puck pursuit and his hockey sense is really underrated. He has the ability to see the game pretty well at both ends of the rink both offensively and defensively. Because of that, you know, we're able to use him with top players. Hornqvist is a guy, he's a bit of a bull in a china closet. He's hard to play against. He plays in the battle areas. He goes to the net. I think he makes it very difficult on our opponent's goaltenders because of how hard he plays in front of the net. He's scored a number of big goals for us throughout the course of this post-season. Maybe the greatest thing that I love about him is just his passion for the game. He wears his emotions right on his sleeve. We love that about him. Thank you."
2016-06-06,"Mike Sullivan",TRUE,"COACH SULLIVAN: That's a good question. I don't know. I give our players a lot of credit. I think we've had pretty good starts. I think everybody's been focused right from the drop of the puck, trying to gain momentum right away. Anytime you can score the first goal in a game, it really increases your chances. I think our guys are just focused on trying to play the game the right way. When the opportunities present themselves, we're trying to take advantage of them. I was saying to the coaching staff after the game, this is the hardest hockey that I've witnessed in all the years I've been associated with this league just as far as how hard both teams have to work for their ice out there. Both teams defend extremely hard. You've got to work for every inch of ice. COACH SULLIVAN: I thought he was really good, not just because he got on the score sheet. Obviously that's great for him, it's great for us. But I thought his overall game was really good. He played at both ends of the rink. When he plays that way, he's so hard to defend. COACH SULLIVAN: Yeah, it is. He's a good player. I love Phil's overall game. Not just tonight, I've liked it through this whole playoffs. Phil's game right now, when you watch him play, for me, when I watch him play, I say to myself, He's committed, he's committed to helping us win. He's playing at both ends of the rink. He's such a scoring threat offensively. You see, I think, sometimes his passing ability flies under the radar. He makes a great play on the power play goal that Geno gets. It's a terrific pass. He passes the puck as well as he can score. What really impresses me about Phil is just his commitment away from the puck, the play in his own end zone. The wall play that he's participating in. He's strong on the puck. He's playing the game the right way now. COACH SULLIVAN: No. We just talked to Geno about not forcing plays, taking what the game gives you, being strong on the puck, not passing up an opportunity to shoot when he gets inside the dots. We're trying to give him some common sense advice on how to simplify your game and be effective. He's such an instinctive player, when he plays the game the right way and he doesn't force things, he sees the plays that he needs to make. I think he's very similar to Kris Letang in that regard. They're well-intentioned because they want to help the team win. They do too much. When they play within themselves, take what the game gives them, when the play is not there to be made, they make simple plays, that's when we, as a group, become more difficult to play against. We don't feed our opponent's transition game. We force them to have to play goal line to goal line. That, for me, is playoff hockey. COACH SULLIVAN: I didn't do anything. For me, Phil deserves the credit for his contribution to helping this team win. Him and I have had conversations throughout the course of the season. We have a very transparent relationship. I try to challenge him in areas of his game where we think he can improve, get better, help our team win. Those are the types of conversations that I've had with him over the last four or five months. I think Phil has made a complete commitment to this team. We don't get to where we're at if Phil doesn't play the type of hockey that he's played here throughout the course of this playoffs. He has been one terrific player for us. He scores big goals. His offense speaks for itself. He's dangerous on the power play. He's dangerous off the rush. But I think what his teammates admire and respect, what his coaching staff certainly does, is his commitment away from the puck and to play at both ends of the rink. COACH SULLIVAN: I think the deeper you get in the playoffs, the better the teams are, the deeper they are, and the harder they defend. As talented as both of these teams are offensively, this is something we've said to our team all year long, it doesn't matter how many goals we score, we have to learn how to defend. We have to learn how to make a commitment to keeping the puck out of our net. I know this team can score. When we start making a commitment to playing away from the puck, keeping the puck out of our net, now we become a team that's, in our opinion, a contender. So the deeper that teams go in the playoffs... I don't think teams get this far if they don't have the ability to defend. I think the top players get the most attention from probably the better defenders. It doesn't surprise me that goals are hard to come by because both teams are making a sincere commitment to playing away from the puck. When I say I think it's the hardest hockey that I've witnessed in this league, it seems like both teams have to fight for every inch out there. That's just the type of hockey that it's become. It's not an easy environment. It's hard hockey. I think both teams have played extremely hard. We certainly have a lot of respect for San Jose and how good they are. But we couldn't be more proud of our players and the way we're playing. Thank you."
2016-06-06,"Evgeni Malkin Matt Murray",TRUE,"MATT MURRAY: I think that's a huge part of their offense, is trying to get pucks through from the point with shots and tips. The more we can stop the puck from getting to our net front, I think the better chance we're going to have. EVGENI MALKIN: Yeah, we not score for three games. Of course, it's simple: if you want win, you need use our power play. We not score first three games. But it's work tonight. MATT MURRAY: Yeah, that's a great question. I think it goes to show you, you can never predict what's going to happen. My mindset has been this whole time to stay in the moment, take things as they come, focus on being in the present and taking things one shot at a time. I think that's been working for me. EVGENI MALKIN: It's our power play, you know. I stay on board, and I go to forecheck if he lost. After, if he win, we try switch. MATT MURRAY: Yeah, I think so. It's always important to try and get the first goal. I mean, it's always important to try and get the next one, too. We've been able to do that. MATT MURRAY: Same thing. Just try to stay in the moment and just worry about the next shot. If you're not getting a lot of shots, you can't just sit there and overthink or do anything like that. You just worry about stopping the next one. It's not in your control. You're not choosing to have no work during the first two periods. It can be difficult. Like I said, you stay focused and worry about the next one."
2016-06-06,"Kris Letang Olli Maatta",FALSE,"KRIS LETANG: I mean, if it's fair for both teams, can't really control that. We only can control what we're about to do on the ice. KRIS LETANG: I mean, I think we have to simplify. I don't think we got into the zone and executed plays, put the puck at the net, put them under pressure on their PK. I think once we get in, move the puck quick, make sure we simplify things. KRIS LETANG: I think we have to do different adjustments out there, especially after Game3. For sure our system and what we're built to be successful is about speed, about quickness, the transition, the tightness of our defense, unit of five. OLLI MAATTA: I think it's just keeping it simple. Obviously there's a couple crazy bounces it took last game. But just and keep it simple. It's the same for both teams. I don't think it really matters that much that way. But just be aware of it. When you get the puck, just make that strong play. As I said many times, keep it simple."
2016-06-06,"Eric Fehr Tom Kuhnhackl",FALSE,"ERIC FEHR: Believe it or not, we are trying to score every time we're out there. We want to (indiscernible) and make sure we're having some strong offensive zone time. We want to take the puck to the net, or get it up to the point, try to get some net-front presence. ERIC FEHR: That was a huge year for me. I think the lockout probably helped me more than anything, just getting back to playing and feeling healthy again. ERIC FEHR: I don't think we really need to make too many adjustments. We played against big teams, heavy checking teams in the past. We've found a way around it. ERIC FEHR: For both of us, it's great. We don't want to have to go out there and kill penalties and we're not giving up the power play. I think five-on-five is fine with our team. We want to play a fast-paced game, play five-on-five. At the same time it's nice to get a couple power plays and get some of our top guys out there, get them some opportunities. TOM KUHNHACKL: If you look at Matt Murray, every time he's in the net, he's been huge for us. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him. He's been huge for us. If we lose a game, we just got to be ready for the next game. ERIC FEHR: To be honest, I think we're in a better rhythm when we're taking less penalties. I feel like we're a little bit more prepared. We have the energy to make sure we're at the right spots at the right times. TOM KUHNHACKL: I mean, I just started a couple weeks earlier than the other guys. I can't keep up with older guys (indiscernible)."
2016-06-06,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: It helped us the other night, sure. It would be similar to them moving Crosby, Malkin and Kessel together. You have three great players playing together. But in order to do that, that hurts you in other parts of the lineup. You have to be comfortable you can survive doing that with the other parts. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, we'd like the lead. The game plan isn't not to play with the lead. We're trying (laughter). I think early in the playoffs, it was a huge part. I think the L.A. series, we had the lead almost every game, maybe other than one. It's a big part. The scores show that. The team that scores first usually wins. We get it. We've got to find a way to get it going. It's not like this has been an issue throughout the playoffs. I think we've actually been pretty good at getting the first goal throughout the playoffs. COACH DeBOER: We've talked about it all year. Not only when you shorten your bench, when Tomas Hertl goes down, you've got somebody that you can put on the wing with Joe and Jumbo. They're not going to look at you like, What are we doing here? They're comfortable. They feel that replacement, there's not going to be a significant drop-off. COACH DeBOER: Very perceptive (laughter). That's important. If you start thinking you've taken a huge step back because someone has gone down, those kind of planted seeds become issues. So I don't think that's the case. COACH DeBOER: I think the way Pittsburgh plays, every opportunity they get, they're fronting, looking to knock pucks down. As opposed to getting involved in boxing you out, they're looking to knock them down and go the other way. We've got to get them by that wall of blockers some way, somehow, either with high tips or using the boards or going around them or going through them. The ones that have got through, we scored on some of them, Justin Braun's goal the other night. We're going to keep shooting. We have some plans in place to try and get around that. But it's definitely been an issue, and a credit to them for what a job they've done so far on that. Thank you."
2016-06-06,"Peter DeBoer",TRUE,"COACH DeBOER: I don't know. That wasn't the difference in the game tonight so... COACH DeBOER: There's no quit in our group. We've been the best road team in the league. We're going to show up and try to get this back here for Game 6. Until you win four, this isn't over. We've been chasing the game the whole series by not scoring first. That takes you out of your four-line rhythm. It affects all parts of your game. We've been on the other end of that in the playoffs where we've jumped out to the lead on some teams and made them change their game. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, it's tough. Again, I think when you have the lead, you can play differently. You feel a lot more comfortable getting in a four-line rhythm, putting your guys out there, trusting them. There's not that pressure that we have to create a scoring chance or score a goal. We can just manage the game, put our time in. I think they've done a good job of that because they've had the lead, and we haven't put ourselves in that situation yet. We've got to find an answer for that. COACH DeBOER: Sure, there's frustration. I thought those guys played hard. I thought there was goals out there. I thought we had a chance to score, you know, at least a couple tonight. We had some really good looks. Their goalie made some saves, we didn't finish. I thought, especially in the third, but even parts of the second, even early in the first, we had some good looks. Probably some of the most quality scoring chances we created. We did some good stuff defensively, too. We didn't allow them to get as many pucks to the net. They had some quality chances when we had to open it up a little bit. COACH DeBOER: His status is day-to-day. Whoever that reporter is isn't in our room, isn't with our doctors, isn't part of our group. I'm giving you what I've got. He's day-to-day. Thank you."
2016-06-05,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: He'll be fine. The one thing we love about him is his makeup and his ability to move by circumstances that maybe aren't what he had hoped they'd be, and just focus on the next game or the next save. I think Matt, that's one of his strengths. His body of work throughout the course of this playoffs has been terrific. We know he's going to make the timely save for us moving forward. COACH SULLIVAN: He's such a talented player. He has the ability to be a difference maker on any given shift. We certainly don't want to discourage him from that. I think one of the things we've always impressed upon our group is we are a coaching staff that doesn't believe in taking the sticks out of their hands. We want our players to make plays. We want them to act on their instincts. We also want them to have calculated risk in mind. When we always use the phrase 'we want to play the game the right way,' a lot of it starts with the decisions we make with the puck, with an understanding of situational play. Geno is no different. He is buying into our team concept here. He's been a big part of this playoff success. But certainly I know that there's another level that he has to help us win. COACH SULLIVAN: I'm not sure he's giving it up too quickly. When you get this far in the playoffs, the teams you're playing against, they defend hard. There's not a lot of ice out there. I don't know that anybody has the puck on their stick for any length of time out there. I think it's hard to do it by yourself. I think the give-and-go game, the cooperative game, is the game that's being played out there. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think there is less penalties called. It just seems like that's the trend in the playoffs. You usually don't get a lot of opportunities on the power play. If you have a chance to make it work, that's great. I thought last night the biggest challenge that we had was on our entries. We only had one power play. We struggled with any sort of clean entries and it limited our zone time. COACH SULLIVAN: I think they've done a terrific job. They've all stepped up. Some guys, we've asked them to play more significant roles. I think these guys are giving us everything they have back there. They're blocking shots, they're defending hard, they're helping us come out of our end zone. Brian Dumoulin, his game has evolved. We're asking him to play in certain power play situations, he's killing penalties. He's playing in every situation both offensively and defensively. I think collectively as a group, they're giving us everything they have. Thank you."
2016-06-05,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Well, I mean, they make a commitment to block. We've got to keep shooting. We've got to work for lanes. There's not much you can do. It can't deter us from shooting the puck. COACH DeBOER: Well, I mean, we heard throughout the playoffs how they were going to expose our third line. He's playing minutes against Malkin, against Crosby. He's been fantastic. He's gotten better and better as the season has gone. It hasn't been an easy road. He's had some bumps there, was down for a couple days. Healthy scratched him a few times. COACH DeBOER: One, they shoot from everywhere. They sling pucks from everywhere. You do have to look at quality versus quantity. I don't think it's as easy as looking at the shot clock and saying you're getting dominated because they've got 40 shots and you've got 26. I don't think the game is that simple. They get pucks to the net. We can probably do a better job of limiting that, getting in some more lanes. Historically during the year, we've been one of the best shot-blocking teams in the league. But they fire from everywhere, every angle, all over the place, then cause confusion around the net. COACH DeBOER: Those guys get a lot of attention. You get asked the same thing about Malkin and some of the guys on their end. It's tough this time of year. Every round, he's getting a lot of attention, just like Brent Burns is getting a lot of attention, just like Jumbo is getting a lot of attention. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, I mean, I spent a month with them at the World Championships. He only played one game. I got to be on the ice at practice with him. Got to know him a little bit as a guy and as a teammate. I loved his disposition, his composure, his work ethic, the practices we had. I saw what Doug and his scout saw when we acquired him, the tools and disposition were there. You never know how a guy is going to handle the starting job playing every night until you throw him into it. That was the million-dollar question. I think through the first half of the year, we had some tough starts. We were on the road a lot. Couture was out of the lineup. We were under some heavy pressure in a lot of those games. He just kept coming out and playing well. COACH DeBOER: I don't know about that. I know that's part of our identity, is being hard and heavy. They have some hard, heavy players, though, too. Sidney Crosby is as hard, heavy a guy as there is in the league. He's not the biggest guy in the world. COACH DeBOER: Johan is an exceptional guy. Probably played in the NHL two or three years longer than he might have because of what a good teammate he is, how hard he worked, his work ethic, his personality. I just thought all those attributes would make him an excellent coach. While I was coaching him in New Jersey, I actually talked to him after he retired, that I thought he'd have the opportunity to make an excellent coach one day, not knowing that we would ever work together again. Then when I got the job, we were looking at goalie coaches, he was the first guy that I thought of. COACH DeBOER: I thought he was excellent last night. With what he's dealt with, I don't know if you can understand the emotion of kind of the last week for him, last couple weeks. He's known this day was coming. For him to play through and do what he's done for us, I can't say enough about that. I know his teammates appreciate it. He's one of those quiet guys that just shows up every day and punches in, does his job. Really we wouldn't be here without him either. He's been exceptional. COACH DeBOER: I think both teams are going to raise their level next game. It's a critical game. It's one of those crossroad type games, I think. I anticipate both teams to come out. I think it should be the best game of the series. I think every game's gotten a little bit better. I think the next one will be the best one so far. As far as lines go, Melker, like the rest of our group, was great. He was tenacious, on the puck. He was in on the forecheck, caused the turnover on the overtime goal. We've got a lot of guys, we talk about interchangeable parts, but we have a lot of guys that play on our third line, play on our fourth line, that can jump up or have played higher in the lineup in the past. I think when you have really good players up top, you can have those interchangeable parts. Pittsburgh has got it. You look at the guys they pair with Malkin or Crosby. They're not household names, some of them. Because you have quality people up top, you can stick in complementary guys like that, and they can be very effective. I think Melker is one of those guys. Thank you."
2016-06-04,"Mike Sullivan",TRUE,"COACH SULLIVAN: It's tough. There haven't been a ton of power plays. It's not easy to get into any sort of rhythm. I don't think our entries have been as clean in this series as we've been. In the prior series, our entries have been really successful, high percentage of entry possessions. I don't think they've been quite as clean. We've had a few near misses. So if we score on one of them, when you only have a few, your percentage changes pretty quick. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, it certainly is a big part of their offense, their cycle game. They use the points a lot, then they look for those wrist shots, those half-slappers, and they're looking for deflections. They use their size. That's a big part of how they generate offense. COACH SULLIVAN: No, I don't think so. We tried to make some space plays to get our speed going. There were times when we had momentum. There were times when they had momentum. I liked a lot of things we did in the game tonight. We didn't get the result, but we played hard. We had some great opportunities to score. We had stretches of momentum. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, we talked with our team about simplifying the game. It's hard to make a lot of lateral plays when the puck's bouncing. As the game wore on, we talked to them about just simplifying the game, playing forward, putting pucks at the net, not looking for the extra pass. I think anytime when you play this late in the year, I think a lot of times the ice breaks down, no matter where you are. Just simplifying the process, playing straight ahead, not looking for that extra pass. A lot of times when you do, the puck bounces, it bobbles. Sometimes you can feed the opponent's transition game. Thank you."
2016-06-04,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, when I played in it, as you said, the building was brand-new. This building has always been an exciting place to play. The acoustics in the building are terrific. There's a lot of excitement. It's a loud building. I've been back a fair amount of times either as a player or as a coach since. Every time, at least my experience of coming here, every time our teams have played in here, it's been that same atmosphere. It seems like it's a real exciting place to play for a player. COACH SULLIVAN: No, I don't think so. I think part of it is where your team is at. If you would have asked me that question during the regular season, I might have a different answer for you. But I think where we're at right now, I think our players are pretty locked in as far as how we have to play, where we need to improve and get better, what we can learn from game to game, so that we can try to gain some sort of an edge going into the next game. COACH SULLIVAN: I did not have input into that. It happened so long ago, it's hard for me to remember the details surrounding it. Obviously it was a big trade for both organizations at the time. As far as Joe, I think Joe is a great player. He's been a great player in this league a long time. He was a great player for me when he played for me in Boston. I think, like everyone, the more experience that you gain, I think it offers players and coaches alike the benefit of perspective and how you can improve in certain areas to try to become better. COACH SULLIVAN: Oh, I don't know. As you start coaching the group, and you go through the day-to-day process, I think as a coaching staff you get a feeling as to whether or not you have their ear. If you don't, you have to find ways to reach them. My sense was, as we started to go through the process every day, trying to get better and trying to improve as a team, our coaching staff, we felt as though our players were being receptive, that we had their ear, they were buying in. COACH SULLIVAN: I think it really helped me a lot having had the opportunity to coach those players in Wilkes-Barre for the first part of the season because it gave me a chance to get to know them, the types of players that they are. When they did get called up, I knew how to utilize those guys and put them in positions to be successful as far as casting them in certain roles, giving them opportunities with certain lines or power plays or penalty kills, wherever we placed those guys. I think it was a great benefit to me to have had that opportunity to coach those guys because I saw what they were able to accomplish at the American League level. I had strong feelings that these guys, their respective individual games could transfer to the NHL level. I don't think you ever know for sure until players actually experience it. But we felt as though these guys could help the Pittsburgh Penguins. COACH SULLIVAN: I think it's just his makeup. He doesn't give you a lot in between periods. He's very calm, cool, collected. He just goes about his business. I don't have a lot of interaction with him during the course of a game. I consciously try to stay away from him and just let him do his thing. He has his routine in between periods, before games, his preparation process that he goes through. As I said all along here, he has a maturity level beyond his age. But certainly I think just his makeup serves him well when the stakes are high. When you get into overtime games, the stakes don't get any higher. COACH SULLIVAN: Because I think they believe in one another. I think they believe in themselves. I think they believe in the group. So for all those reasons, I think we've been able to overcome some challenging injuries that we faced in the second half of the season. Our team has been doing it for a while now. We've had some key guys go down for a long period of time in the regular season, and we were able to find ways to continue to win games and put ourselves in the best position for this post-season. As we go into the post-season, I think it's been the same thing. I think it goes back to just the team concept and the belief in the team. We're not asking anybody to replace a player that goes down. It's tough to replace Geno Malkin or Trevor Daley, for that matter, but what we are asking players to do is to come in and help this team win by playing to their strengths and bringing to the table the skill sets that they have to help us win. That's what our guys do. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, he might be one of the most impactful athletes in this past century. He's obviously a charismatic guy, did a lot for the sport of boxing. I think he'll be, at least from my experience, known not just for how great of an athlete he was, but for the impact that he had in a social aspect as well. COACH SULLIVAN: I think it's important to get away from it. It's an intense battle. Sometimes just to get away from it, to take your mind off it, recharge your batteries, reenergize yourself I think is a good thing. I think balance in your life is important. So when players have an opportunity to get away from it a little bit, spend some time together doing something else, some sort of an activity, get their minds off the game, when they do come back to the rink, I think they're that much more energized and their mental focus is much better. Certainly we encourage our players all season long, because of the nature of our game, how difficult it is, to make sure that we maintain some sort of balance in our life. Thank you."
2016-06-04,"Bryan Rust Conor Sheary",FALSE,"CONOR SHEARY: Well, I'll say he's a really competitive guy. He might not show it off the ice or whatever, but when he gets on the ice for practice or whatever, he never allows a goal in his net. When he does, he gets pretty pissed off. I think that competitive nature just plays over into the game for him. CONOR SHEARY: Yeah, it was a pretty cool experience. You expect to hear from your close friends and family. It's the same group of people you hear from throughout the whole playoffs. When you score a goal or when you win a series, you kind of hear from the same people. BRYAN RUST: When I first met him, I got a little bit of a vibe that he might be too intense. But then later on in the conversation, he cracked a joke, so I kind of realized I think he might know when to be intense, when to have fun, which I think helps a young guy stay loose. BRYAN RUST: Before I got here, it would have had to have either been at the University of Michigan, maybe North Dakota or Hershey in the American League. Those three stand out in my mind. Being able to come in the NHL and play in some of these rinks with the loud crowds, intimidating environments, it's fun. It kind of seems to give me a little bit more energy, too. CONOR SHEARY: I think we have a pretty similar experience throughout the regular season, me and Rusty. Throughout the playoffs, you kind of mold into a team more than any other time because you always have to stick together. I think the older guys in the room have done a great job at bringing us young guys in and making us enjoy the experience while it's here. I think we're just embracing it as much as we can. BRYAN RUST: I think, yeah, I guess on any given night, pretty much any player or any line can kind of step up and play really well, make big plays, score big goals. That's been kind of a huge, important part for us in the playoffs here. CONOR SHEARY: Yeah, I think the trust goes both ways. I think you have to trust your coach to believe in his system. We always had a really good start in Wilkes-Barre for anyone who's following, so we kind of knew the system worked. When we came up here, we already knew what was going on, how he was going to run the team. It was an easy transition for a lot of us. CONOR SHEARY: Just his competitive nature was above all else, I think. Obviously that famous picture of him. Just his competitive nature, you always follow that as a kid. He's a little bit older than our generation. You look at those things and learn how to compete like he did. BRYAN RUST: For me, it's seeing the legacy that he built for himself, how so many people admired him, respected him, saw him as a great role model. It's just one of those things you can learn from. It's sad to have this happen, but it's also a time to celebrate his life."
2016-06-04,"Joonas Donskoi Joel Ward",TRUE,"JOONAS DONSKOI: Well, I decided to stay in Finland a little bit longer than maybe usual. Kind of waited the right moment to come over. I had couple of good years last seasons and year before that, two championships. I kind of got the experience what you have to do to be professional hockey player 24/7, what you have to do to success. JOONAS DONSKOI: Pretty good. I think this was best game from myself. Created tonight from whole team. We had lot of scoring chances. JOEL WARD: I guess you probably got to talk to defense about that one. You know, that's a good sign. If you're playing the offensive zone, they're blocking shots, you're getting opportunities. Keep firing away. JOEL WARD: It's always a good feeling to help contribute for your squad. Obviously you're in the moment and you're just wanting to score and help your team win. Just knowing here we're at the Stanley Cup Finals, you just want to help, hopefully continue on this process, build on the next game, try to contribute again. Try not to dwell or think about it too much. JOONAS DONSKOI: Yeah, just got the first win in the Stanley Cup Finals. I don't think about that too much. Now we get going. We can still get better. JOONAS DONSKOI: No (laughter). JOEL WARD: I don't know. I just visualize. I've watched other sports. I've watched other guys and always tried to emulate, listen to their quotes. I got one from Paul Pierce. I watched him in the playoffs the last couple seasons. People always knocked him down a little bit in the regular season, but in the playoffs he always stepped up. JOONAS DONSKOI: They were first team to show the interest in me, so that was big thing. Yeah, we think about it with my agent. I think Sharks is great organization, doing great work, lot of great guys, good leadership guys like Pav, Jumbo, Marleau, Wardo coming in. I thought might have room for a young guy like me, so that would be a great balance. But, yeah, great organization. I'm so happy that I picked Sharks."
2016-06-04,"Peter DeBoer",TRUE,"COACH DeBOER: I met Joonas at our development camp last July. I heard about his season in Finland. Our guys, everyone, felt that he had a chance to play down the road. I think everyone first saw him starting in the American League. He was our best player in development camp. We went on to the main camp, he was the best player in the main camp, exhibitions. He just kept jumping over hurdles. COACH DeBOER: I thought Vlasic and Braun, you have to mention Braun when you mention Vlasic, too, I thought those two were excellent for us tonight, both ends of the rink. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, well, I mean, huge. That was our opportunity. The door kind of opened up there. We haven't had a lot of power plays. We got one. We needed to cash in there. Called the timeout in order to keep our first unit out. That's kind of been the history of our group, the second unit's come up big at different points for us. That's what happened. They hopped over for the last 10 seconds. COACH DeBOER: That's a big part of their game. They chip to speed. I think some of the icing calls probably helped them because the ones that got waved off allowed them to continue their momentum. I thought there was a couple of questionable ones there. COACH DeBOER: It was big to get a win whether he was out or in. We needed to win this game tonight. Our group all year has been next guy jump in. We wouldn't have made the playoffs if we didn't have that attitude. Logan Couture missed half the season. We had guys step in and fill those roles. Allowed us to keep our heads above water. COACH DeBOER: They were feeling good tonight. The two days off helped. Obviously the biggest game of the year. At that point I thought we were going to live and die with the big guys. We needed the win. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, it was electric. It was amazing to stand back there. You could tell that these people have been waiting a long time. I think the guys really wanted to play hard for them. I thought we were a little jittery early probably because of that. I thought once we settled in, they were a big help for us. It was a grind of a game out there. They were playing hard. They knew that they would have put us in a deep, deep hole tonight had they won. Our desperation level was as high as it could be. Fans were a big help for us tonight. COACH DeBOER: It's huge. It's the first time we've had the lead in this series. We have to go home. It's all right, I'm not complaining about it. We have to find a way to get out in front going forward. We've been playing from behind too often in the series. That's something that we want to talk about. But it was a huge win. Changes the series. Now we've got to take care of business Game4. Thank you."
2016-06-04,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: I think if you've seen our group, they tend to keep each other pretty loose. They're a loose group. They know when to dial in and be ready to play, when to relax. COACH DeBOER: We have a couple guys that played in that hole before. Melker has, so has Zubrus, been effective. The one thing with those two guys is, you got a guy that will hound the puck and work for it. Those two guys pretty much take care of the rest. COACH DeBOER: Our PK has been a slow build all year. I think we've taken a couple steps forward, a step back. But I think it's been really good at the right times this year, especially in the playoffs. It's important you win the special teams battle. There really hasn't been a special teams battle yet in this series. But you never say never, and you anticipate at some point it will be very important. COACH DeBOER: It's a great question. That's probably something that we'll reflect on after everything's done. I think in the moment right now, we need to win a game. I can tell you, just being the first year in the area for me, the gravity of winning the Western Conference, I've had people that have been watching the team for 25 years come up to me, tears in their eyes. It was an important moment. COACH DeBOER: We have a lot of leadership in our room. It's definitely by committee. I don't think there's any come-to moments or big speeches. It's just all the right messaging. COACH DeBOER: It has to be an advantage. It's been an advantage the entire playoffs for us. I think it was definitely an advantage for Pittsburgh in Pittsburgh. We've got to make sure. That's a small piece of it, though. We have to do our part. I know the fans are going to do their part, and we've got to do our part tonight. I know that's the last question, but I just want to end with a quick thing on Muhammad Ali. Lost a great person. The reason I want to speak about him, I'm not a collector of sports memorabilia, but I have three things in my basement. I have a Wayne Gretzky stick, a Bobby Orr print, a Mike Weir Masters print, and I have a Koran signed by Muhammad Ali. I wouldn't normally share this with you, but I think considering the circumstances today. I got it 30 years ago. I was at my prom at the Royal Connaught Hotel in Hamilton. I was a 17-year-old kid. Had my tux on. I was in the lobby. Muhammad Ali walked in with his entourage. He was there for some type of appearance. I asked one of the entourage if I could meet him with my friends. He said to give him a minute. He came back to me and he said, Muhammad Ali is up in this room. Meet him up in his room in five minutes. Me and three or four of my buddies went up to the room. He got out a Koran for each of us. He wasn't preaching or trying to convert us, he just personalized each one for us, asked us some questions about what we were doing. It was an unbelievable life experience for me. I think, considering the circumstances, how this guy transcended not just boxing and sport, but how many people he's touched, it's an appropriate story to tell. I know you guys have the time, too, to listen (laughter)."
2016-06-04,"Ian Cole Olli Maatta",FALSE,"IAN COLE: I think the first thing you notice is he has a very authoritative voice, very deep. When he's giving it to you, you really pay attention, which I think is good. He made the points that, We're not going to waste your time. When we are having a meeting, make sure you're paying attention and you're there early 'cause everything we say is going to be important. I think guys took that to heart. OLLI MAATTA: I'm not trying to change my game. I'm trying to play the same way. Obviously it's a big difference playing with Tanger and playing with Lovey. Tanger is more offensive. Lovey is more a defensive-first guy. IAN COLE: I think that whole line really works well together. You have Thornton, who is certainly more of a pass-first guy, can dish the puck with the best guys in the league. Obviously you have Pavelski who still skates very well, but is more of a shoot-first guy, finding that soft ice in the pocket really well. You have Hertl who seemingly does everything very well. That whole line really works together. You've seen that in the course of the playoffs, how successful they've been, how dominant they've been in a lot of situations. But specifically Hertl, like I said, I think he's good at everything. He's maybe not the best in the league at one particular thing, but he's really, really good at everything. Great speed, strong, can take pucks at the net, has an outside shot as well. OLLI MAATTA: Steve Oleksy had some high school friends there. He was able to take us there and show us around. It was pretty cool. I see the movie Internship, that's pretty much the only thing I knew about it. IAN COLE: If that's going to be the game plan for them, we'll welcome that. I think we're very confident in all six of our defensemen, their ability to play defense against any line, their ability to transition the puck well and go on offense. If that's what they want to do, that's fine. Obviously who you're playing, it does make a difference. Every line plays different, every player plays different. Having awareness as far as who you're out there with, knowing their tendencies, making sure that you're aware when you have a guy like Tomas Hertl or Joe Thornton, how they kind of attack certain plays, what they try to do on the ice. Thornton isn't going to burn you with speed, but he'll certainly try to draw you out towards him to put the puck through you to a guy behind you. IAN COLE: Yeah, I mean, I've used this statement a lot. I think everyone's aware of the situation. I mean, to say that we're not thinking about it, it's true to a certain extent, but I think you're aware. You understand where you are in the timeline of a seven-game series, the situation as far as how many wins you have. But I don't think you can let that dictate how you play, can't let that dictate how you're going to approach the game. I think that once you take your foot off the gas, once you kind of exhale and say, Hey, we have a two-game lead, we only have to win two more out of the next five, that will be easy, no problem, that's where you really get into trouble. I think continuing to play with the same mindset, just keep going the way you were."
2016-06-03,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, we're dealing with the same challenges that San Jose's dealing with. I think the fact that we have the extra day in between is certainly helpful. We're trying to keep our guys on the same time schedule from a routine standpoint. I think our strength and conditioning guys, our medical staff, does a great job as far as making sure that we do everything within our power to help them nutritionally and otherwise so that they can recover properly and fuel their bodies the right way. COACH SULLIVAN: I don't think so. I think our players are accustomed to it at this point. I think we've talked to them throughout this post-season about making sure that we stay focused and not allow any of the noise surrounding our team to have an impact on our mindset or our focus that's necessary to have success. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, we've tried to challenge Phil, like we do all of our players, to become a more complete player. At least based on my experience in coaching in this league, when you're coaching the top players, the offensive players that have great offensive instincts, usually the conversations revolve around playing away from the puck and the decisions they make with the puck. So Phil is no different. We've had a number of conversations on trying to help him improve in areas of his game. To his credit, he's been very receptive. I think he's really worked at it. I think we're all seeing the rewards of his work right now. I think he's playing the right way. He's been much better on the boards. I think his determination to play away from the puck and defend in our end zone is much improved. That's a credit to him. COACH SULLIVAN: They're similar guys. One is a right-handed shot, one is a left-handed shot. We actually used both of those guys last game on the power play. Sometimes the first unit gets extended time. Both Horny and Kuny play hard minutes. They're the guys helping them retrieve pucks, they play in front of the net, they're taking cross checks. They're hard minutes they play. COACH SULLIVAN: I really think our team is playing the game the right way right now. I think we're doing the right things. He's made some timely saves for them. I think any time you're trying to score goals, it's about trying to get pucks to the net, trying to get people to the net, trying to make it difficult on the opponent's goaltender by impeding the sight lines, limiting the mobility by having people in the area. We'll continue to work at that, try to get better at that. That's something that we've preached to our team all year long. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, it's critically important. Our team discipline has been really good. We've talked about that every day. That has to continue to be one of the focal points of our team, is making sure we play in between the whistles and we don't put ourselves in a position where we have to take a stick infraction because maybe we overstay a shift and we're tired. For me, it always boils down to the details of the game, just paying attention to the details. If you do that, if we do that as a group, I think we can avoid some of the unnecessary or the avoidable penalties that sometimes end up hurting you. COACH SULLIVAN: I think when you look at the makeup of our lines, I've said this on a number of occasions, for me it's pick your poison. Any particular line on a given night might be the best line of our team depending on who's going, who's playing well. One of the things that we really like about the makeup of our forward lines right now is the balance. We have threats on every line. I think that presents potential challenges for our opponents from a matchup standpoint. Someone is going to get a favorable matchup. From that standpoint, I think whether we're at home or we're on the road, I think it makes it harder on our opponents because of that. I think that Bones' line has been as good as it is for so long because it starts with their chemistry. They're feeling it right now. Their confidence is at an all-time high. I think the longer they've been together, they've learned each other's tendencies, they know how to play to their strengths. COACH SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think he has. I think Geno's adapted. I give him a lot of credit for that. I think because of that, we've become a team. It's not just about one or two or three guys that help us win every night. I think what's allowed this team to have the success that it's enjoyed the last few months is just it seems like every night different people step up and make big plays for us at key times. Sometimes it's an overtime goal or a big goal, or sometimes it's a great penalty kill or a one faceoff or a blocked shot. It's both big plays, but also subtle plays that help us become more difficult to play against and help our team win. I think Geno has done a great job just adapting to our team game, and adapting his game to how this team is playing right now. He's a really talented player. He has the ability to play a lot of different ways. He can beat you with speed. He can beat you with skill. He's got a great shot. He can play underneath the hashmarks and play a grind game because he's big and strong. He has the ability to generate offense a number of different ways. Depending on who we use on his line with his linemates, he has the ability to adapt. I think he's done a terrific job there."
2016-06-03,"Matt Murray",FALSE,"MATT MURRAY: No. There's no comparison, I don't think, to Ken Dryden. Makes me pretty uncomfortable actually to hear that. MATT MURRAY: It's all mostly the same. You probably won't skate in the morning. During the season we play a lot of afternoon games. I played a lot of 5:00 games in the American League on Sundays and stuff like that. MATT MURRAY: I don't know if we really need any external motivation. We're motivated from within, I think. We just want to win like everybody else. MATT MURRAY: First time ever in California. It seems like hockey is definitely growing. It's not exactly known as a hockey state by any means. You look around the rink here, you see all these kids running around. Everybody is into the hockey thing. It's cool. It's my first time here, so I can't really speak to how it's evolved or anything. I love it. I'm not used to the hot weather this time of year. I'm from pretty far up north in Ontario. The hot kind of bugs me a little bit. But I really like it. MATT MURRAY: Yeah, definitely. The biggest thing for me is just kind of focusing on your breathing. I think that brings you back to being in the moment. That's something I do a lot, something I work on a lot. It's something so simple. You think, Can that really have anything to do with it. It definitely helps. As soon as you start thinking about too much, you start getting too far ahead of yourself, you kind of come back to that, focus on your breathing, take a deep breath, realize where you are, realize the moment you're in. That's probably the biggest thing that I do, I would say. MATT MURRAY: Thank you."
2016-06-03,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Last change, home crowd, sleeping in your own bed, I think all those things are important in the playoffs. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, we talked about some things that we think we can do better today. I think our support, not just coming out of our own zone, but all over the ice, is always important. A little bit off. Obviously, you have to give them some credit. Their speed pushes you into positions where if you're off by a couple feet, you're in trouble. COACH DeBOER: That's a good question. There's a lot going on here. I think we talked at the beginning of the Finals about limiting distractions. I think that's one of the things about being at home that our group has been talking about. Got a lot of people in town, a lot of family, a lot of friends want to be a part of this. We're prepared on that side. COACH DeBOER: I don't know if I'm different. I think what you learn is you don't get to this point unless you have a lot of character, a lot of leadership and you're a good hockey team. What I learned that year with the Devils, we went in a 3-0 hole. Everybody was saying it was going to be a sweep, it was over. I actually thought going into Game 6 we felt pretty confident that we could win and bring it back to New Jersey for Game 7. COACH DeBOER: I think we got to have the puck more. I think we got to attack a little bit more. I think there's penalties out there, I do believe that. I think there even has been in the first couple games. COACH DeBOER: Well, Crosby is a key guy, probably their best player through the first two games. He's not the only guy. They've given us matchup problems, not just us, but other teams. When you have Kessel, Crosby and Malkin on three different lines, I mean, all three of those guys make more than anybody on our team. That's matchup problems for everybody all playoffs. COACH DeBOER: You always want to play with the puck more. I think we were prepared that this was going to be a different series. Just look at Pittsburgh's record from Christmas on. Look at their analytics from Christmas on. Look at what they've done against some very good teams and how they've made them look. I think we're prepared for this more than maybe some of the people watching. This is going to be a series of momentum. We're going to have it for a little bit; they're going to have it for a little bit. I think it's whoever can carry it for more. It's not going to look like maybe some of the series in the past where we've dominated for long stretches. They're a very good hockey team. They're not going to allow you to do that. We've got to be comfortable in that. We can't get frustrated by that. Thank you."
2016-06-02,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: I think when you look at the way the game is being played, there's momentum swings on both sides. These are two pretty good hockey teams going at it. There are times when we have momentum and territory and zone time. When San Jose makes a push, they have good players, they're a good team, they're going did try to do the same. That's really the way I see it. That's the way the first two games have played out. I really like how our team has played. I think when we have had defensive zone time, I think we've defended extremely hard. We've defended extremely well as a group cooperatively. COACH SULLIVAN: No, I'm not concerned at all. Listen, all centers that go in there and take faceoffs, they're trying to get an edge. That's just the reality of it. They're doing the same things our guys are doing. The way I look at it, that's all part of being a center iceman, trying to figure out a way to get an edge and be successful. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, Conor really has done a great job for us. He's had a little bit of a whirlwind of a year, being called up, sent down a few times. Just going through the evolution of a pro player, I think, in the development process. But each time he's got called back up, he's brought a level of consistency to his game and has brought more of a contribution to this team. I can't say enough about what he's done for our team here in the post-season. He plays a lot of critical minutes for us. He plays in a difficult role, playing with Crosby, which is not an easy thing to do when a young player has to play or is asked to play with top players, because there's an expectation there. I think Conor has handled it extremely well. COACH SULLIVAN: I would expect them to certainly have a strong push. San Jose is a very good hockey team. They're good at home. I'm sure their fan base will give them a boost of energy. So we would expect that. We expected the same push from Game2, which they did, as well. COACH SULLIVAN: I think they've done a great job as a group of six. They really have been our unsung heroes. They go back for pucks, they take hits, they make plays, they help us get out of our end zone, defending extremely hard, blocking shots. I think they're doing a lot of those thankless jobs that don't necessarily show up on the score sheet or it's difficult to quantify in a statistic. They just help teams win. COACH SULLIVAN: It's as good as I've seen him play, yes. What I've really admired about Sid's game is just his overall complete game. It's not just about offense. He's winning faceoffs. He's defending. He does so many of the little things at both ends of the rink that are helping us win right now. I think his offense speaks for itself. But what I've really grown to admire watching him over the last few months is just his overall complete game. He is a real good two-way player, his attention to detail away from the puck down low in our end zone, defending when the time is called upon to defend. He's really been the leader of this group in more ways than one. COACH SULLIVAN: What we've really liked about our team is just our overall team defense. It's not just about playing in our end zone, it's about our puck-pursuit game up the ice. I think we're best when we're defending 180 feet from our net, where we're forcing our opponents to have to make plays under pressure, limiting zone time, keeping our gaps tight. Our coaching staff has really been very pleased with how hard our guys are playing, the cooperative effort that's taking place amongst the five guys in front of Matt, regardless of which zone it is. When we do end up in our end zone, we have a brave group. We're willing to block shots. We're getting in the shot lanes. We're boxing out and trying to get sticks in front to make Matt's job as easy as possible as far as his sight lines and his movement. COACH SULLIVAN: I think you have to give a lot of credit to our locker room. I think our veteran guys have done a terrific job as far as welcoming these guys into the locker room, making them feel comfortable, making them feel a big part of the team. They've been great mentors for these kids when they're called up. I also think you got to give credit to the young players. They've come up and they've performed. They've played extremely well. I think our veteran guys appreciate what they're bringing to the table as far as helping this team win. There's credit to go around on both sides. But for me, the dynamic that's taking place in the locker room right now, I spoke about it on a number of occasions here in the post-season, about the chemistry that this group has. We really like the mix we have of our veteran players and our young guys that are bringing the energy and the enthusiasm to the rink every day. It's a credit to everyone involved. I think we've got a close-knit locker room. These guys really enjoy playing for one another. That's really a powerful dynamic. COACH SULLIVAN: Thank you, guys."
2016-06-02,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: Strengths and weaknesses in the last game? I thought we did a better job of limiting their time and space. We got the shot totals down from 40, which is an unacceptable level for us, into the 20s. I still think we can improve there. I thought just our overall game in all areas was a little bit better. It's still not where it needs to be, but it was a little bit better. COACH DeBOER: I think it's a little combination of both. I think they've done a good job of taking away our time and space, particularly of our better players. I think everyone tries to do that to the other team. So I think you have to give them some credit for that. I. COACH DeBOER: Well, it's very meaningful to the people here. I think I saw the emotion after we won the Western Conference that night and the days following that before we left for Pittsburgh. It's important to the people here. COACH DeBOER: Justin Braun traveled today to pay his respects to his father- in-law, is going to return to San Jose either tonight or tomorrow. He will definitely be in for Game3. As far as matchups go, it's always nice to have the last change. There's always some certain matchups you're looking to get. At the same time, Pittsburgh presents some matchup issues for everybody they played. When you have Malkin, Crosby and Kessel on three different lines, that presents matchup issues. COACH DeBOER: No, it's not enough unless you win. It was enough to get us to overtime. At that point you're one shot from winning. It gave us an opportunity to win that game, just like we had an opportunity to win Game1 with two minutes left in the game. Obviously you want to eliminate that margin of error. You don't want to leave it to chance. You don't want to leave it to one shot. You want to, you know, try and take control of the game. But Pittsburgh's a good team. They've shown they're not a team that you're going to control large portions of play against them. You're going to have to wait for your opportunities and cash in. There's little things we can do better, and we'll look at those. COACH DeBOER: I think we competed with them. Again, both games are one-goal games. Both ended late in one and overtime in the other. I think from a compete point, we're right there. Again, we've got to find a few longer stretches where we can control the play a little bit more. There's a few things we can do differently. You have to get your head wrapped around that Pittsburgh, with their numbers, the way they played from the second half of the season on, you're not going to dominate a team like that for long stretches. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, well, I mean, the message to them was tune out the noise. There's a lot of noise. People are going to want to tell you how well Pittsburgh is playing, how poorly you're playing, how you have no chance to win. We need to tune all that out, make sure we're ready for Game3. That's the only thing that matters right now. COACH DeBOER: I thought he gave us some really good energy early. Like a guy who has been out for a month, I thought as the game wore on, you know, the reality of being out that long settled in a little bit on him. COACH DeBOER: You know, I haven't decided if we're going to start where we ended last game. I liked the response we got in the third period. I thought we were better. It gave us a little bit of a jolt. One of the combinations found a way to get a goal. I thought the other combinations started to look a little more dangerous. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, for sure. I think absolutely. I think our guys know that. The nice thing is, and the difference is, we are going home. There's a little more optimism knowing the next two games are in our rink. Credit to them, they held serve, played well at home. Again, we've got to return the favor here in our rink. Thank you."
2016-06-01,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: I think Geno is playing well for us. He's generating scoring chances. That's the thing we watch most is his scoring chance involvement, his primary chances himself. He's been involved in a fair number of chances, both primary and secondary, over the last two series. COACH SULLIVAN: I think he's just been more proactive as far as his skating and forcing the play in all three zones. I think when Chris is at his best, he's real difficult to play against. He brings an element of nastiness to his game, for lack of a better term. He can get in on the forecheck. He's got a physical presence to his game. He really creates havoc. He's hard to play against. That's when he's at his best. I think certainly the last series and Game1 here, we think he's really done a great job as far as forcing opponents to have to make plays under pressure. He creates a lot of turnovers. COACH SULLIVAN: We think they're great. We threw them on the game review for our guys to listen to. They got a kick out of it. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, we like his mobility. We like how quick he gets back to pucks. He has the ability to make that first pass, help us get out of the end zone. He can join the rush. He's real good as far as that fourth man on the attack. He has good offensive instincts. He's good on the blueline. What we tried to do since we got him was try to look at his strengths and try to put him in positions where he can play to his strengths. I've said this all along, we try to look at all of our players for what they can do and not necessarily what they can't. We try to put them into positions where they can play to their strengths. COACH SULLIVAN: We have a comfort level that we can play any of our lines against any opponent's lines. The strength of our team throughout the course of this playoffs has been the balance at the forward group that we have. We think we have guys on each line that have awareness at both ends of the rink. So we really like that balance. I think it makes us more difficult to play against. We chose to use Bones a fair amount against Pavelski's line and Thornton's line because we think their line has awareness at both ends of the rink. I think when you have offensive people that play against other team's offensive people, the benefit of that is when they have the puck, they force those guys to have to play defense. They're threats to score. That's one of the things we like about Bones' line. Bones and Haggy are penalty killers for us. They have very good defensive strengths, defensive skill sets. They have great awareness. They have good sticks. Bones is very good down low in the D zone. COACH SULLIVAN: I think what we see with Rusty is just his skating ability, his speed, his tenacity on the puck, his compete level. He's got a sneaky shot. He can shoot the puck. When you think of those attributes, I think it all adds up to someone that has the potential to score. He scored a few goals here throughout the course of the post-season. I think his confidence is probably at an all-time high. That helps. But certainly he's a guy that we have viewed all season long as someone that can help us generate offense. Whether he's scoring himself or he's creating opportunities for his linemates through his foot speed, tenacity, forcing turnovers and things of that nature. His compete level, his willingness to go to the net. When you go to the net, good things usually happen. He scores a goal in the last game because he goes to the net. COACH SULLIVAN: I think we can always get better at our craft, at what we do. As a coach, I think you're always trying to grow and improve on how you interact with your players, the vocabulary that you use, the use of the video. We're trying to use every means within our power to try to reach players. We're trying to inspire them. We're trying to help them learn through their experience. That experience of being a player development coach gives me a little bit more perspective. The one thing that really jumped out at me when I did that role for the Hawks last year is I was watching, for the most part, college hockey and junior hockey, the players were younger. What really jumped out at me was how good the NHL players are. I've been used to working with NHL players for so long. I think sometimes we take for granted at the NHL level how good these players are, how polished their games are. When I had the opportunity to see some different levels of hockey, the USHL Division I college hockey, those different levels, I think it really gives you perspective on where players come from and the process that they go through to get to this level. So I think that really helped me as far as opening my eyes, just the development process in general. And just being patient with players because, you know, it's hard sometimes, we want players to be at their best, we see an upside to certain players, we want it to happen overnight. In my experience from being around players, is it usually doesn't happen that way. Usually it's a process that players go through. Sometimes it's faster or slower depending on the individual. But I think for me the key takeaway was I think patience serves you well because there's a lot of real good players that are young. If you give them time and you give them opportunity and you put them in the right environment, I think these guys can blossom into real good players. Thank you."
2016-06-01,"Mike Sullivan",TRUE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think our team has the ability to wear teams down with our puck-pursuit game and forcing defensemen to turn and go back for pucks. It's tiring. It wears on people. COACH SULLIVAN: Yeah, I think Sid, he's just been a horse out there. He's a threat every time he's on the ice. He's playing the game the right way. He plays a complete game, the full sheet. He wins faceoffs. He's great on the puck battles. He can defend. When he plays against the opponent's top players, he has the ability to score goals or create that offensive threat and force them to have to defend. COACH SULLIVAN: One of the things I've really liked about our team, and this is something that I think we've evolved over the last five months or so, but our guys just play. That's what we told them on the bench when it went in the net. You know what, San Jose is a good team. They're going to get some scoring chances. We liked how our team was playing. We felt like we controlled the majority of the play. We just have to keep playing. There's been so many examples of that throughout the course of this post-season with this team that to this point, it doesn't surprise me. I just think we respond the right way to those adversities that take place. It doesn't deflate us. We just get out there the next shift, we drop the puck and we play. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, our message was that very thing: let's just play, let's just keep playing, play the game the right way, let's try to play fast, let's make good decisions with the puck, let's not feed their transition game. When we do that, we're hard to play against. Let's continue to force the issue with our skating, make space plays, get in foot races. That's the type of game that I think plays to our strengths. That was our message to our team. COACH SULLIVAN: I don't know. Phil's a guy, he doesn't show a whole lot of emotion. He just goes over the boards. You tell him his line is up, he goes over the boards, he plays. I think that's part of his personality. He doesn't seem to have any sort of anxiety. He just plays the game that he always plays. That's what he's doing for us. I think Phil's a guy, not too many players in the league can score like him. He really has a knack for finding the back of the net, whether it's in tight, his release on the shot, the velocity of his shot. He's a threat in a lot of ways. He's really helped us when he's found that chemistry with the guys that he's playing with right now. That line has been really, I think, critical in scoring some timely goals for us throughout the course of this playoffs. I think those guys, they're feeling it right now. They have that chemistry. I think they believe in one another. Their confidence is at an all-time high. I think he's part of it. COACH SULLIVAN: No, it doesn't surprise me because I think that's Sid. His work ethic is unmatched. He has an insatiable appetite to get better and be the best. COACH SULLIVAN: I thought for the most part we did a pretty good job. They're tough to handle. When they're down low, they have a lot of big players that protect pucks extremely well. They use their points very well. I thought we were in the shot lanes when we had the opportunity. We had a couple of layers of shot-blockers. I thought our stick detail down low was pretty good as far as trying to get our stick on the puck, disrupting some of the possession so those passes to the points weren't clean. At least they had to handle them, which gave us an opportunity to get in the lanes. COACH SULLIVAN: We just felt as a coaching staff he was wearing down a little bit. I'm probably stating the obvious to say he's not an overly big guy. When you're playing every other night, one of the hardest things about winning the Stanley Cup is the journey to get there. You're playing every other night for a long time. It's the most intense hockey all year long. So our coaching staff felt as though he was wearing down a little bit. We talked to Conor about that. His competitive advantage is his quickness. So if he loses that step, he's not as effective as we know him to be, like he has been the last couple of games, and when he has the necessary energy to play the game that he needs to play. By no means was it a slight on him or his contribution to this team. We're just trying to manage each player and their respective circumstances based on how we know them. COACH SULLIVAN: I think when he first was called up this year, we put him with Sid right away, there was a 'wow' factor with some of the players in the room. My experience of being around this group is when a new player comes to our team, young or old for that matter, I think there's a little bit of a 'wow' factor because some of the players we have. Everybody has so much respect for Crosby and Malkin and Letang and those guys. Over time I think that wears off. I think that's happened with Conor. I also think, you know, Sid and some of our older guys, when they spend time with these guys, they've really taken the young players under their wing. They've done a tremendous job just as far as being mentors for them, making them feel comfortable. Just even in the small conversations on the bench, it goes a long way for helping these guys with their next shifts. I've witnessed that all year long with our veteran group, with some of our young players. But I also think with each time that Conor's got called up, I think he has more of a comfort level of what the expectation is and how he has to play in order to be successful. Part of me thinks that's the evolution of young players when they're trying to establish themselves in this league. There's a learning process that players go through. They realize how hard it is, that they've got to bring the same effort and the same performance and the same execution night after night after night. That, I think, is what separates NHL players from the rest of the world, is their ability to continue to bring a consistency of play that comes to be the expectation. I think Conor has learned that. He's not the only one. The young players, I think they all go through that evolution. I think for those reasons, we're seeing him produce the way he's playing right now. Thank you."
2016-06-01,"Phil Kessel Conor Sheary",TRUE,"CONOR SHEARY: Yeah, I mean, the first time I got on his line he told me I was there for a reason, I was playing with him for a reason, don't look off a shot to make a pass to him. Even though he says that, it's a little hard to get used to. CONOR SHEARY: That's the only thing he left out. It usually doesn't work out like that when you draw up a play or even talk about a play. CONOR SHEARY: Yeah, I think that's the identity of our team. Coach has been trying to implement that all year. I think a lot of guys have bought into that system. It's not always about speed, it's about playing quick, getting pucks up, getting pucks in. I think when we do that, play in people's face, we overwhelm teams. It's been working out well for us."
2016-06-01,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: I think our whole team needs to be better, all those guys included. They know that. I think as a coach, you get to this point, really throughout the playoffs, you want to put your best game out there and see if it's good enough. So far it has been. I think as a group, we didn't do that last game. We want to make sure we throw that at them tonight. Thank you."
2016-06-01,"Peter DeBoer",TRUE,"COACH DeBOER: You know what, I thought we were better tonight than in Game1. Got to find a way to score some five-on-five goals. We only got one in each game. COACH DeBOER: Defensively? I mean, everyone is going to make mistakes. They made mistakes on the goal we scored. The problem is, if you're not scoring, every mistake you make potentially costs you the game. You can't put those things under a microscope this time of year. You have two teams that are playing really tight hockey. One mistake changes the game. You're not going to play mistake-free. COACH DeBOER: We got a little spark. The second line got us the goal, the Braun goal. We needed to change something up. We weren't generating enough after two five-on-five. I liked our third period. We got a few more looks. We found a way to score a goal. COACH DeBOER: Nobody's waiting. The other team wants to play, too. They're very good. They're a good team. They're at home. They have their home crowd. We're playing a team that wants to win as badly as we do and is a very good team. There's going to be ebbs and flows. They're going to take it over for some periods. We're going to take it over for some periods. I thought we were better tonight. But we have to find a way to create some more five-on-five offense. COACH DeBOER: In the breakouts? Again, you know, they're putting pressure on us, like we're putting pressure on them. I don't know the specifics of it. The way you guys make it sound, we never got out of our own end the whole night. This was a game that went back and forth. They're at home. They carried the play for parts. We carried it for parts. We've got to go back home now and get back in the series. Thanks."
2016-05-31,"Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think sometimes we forget how young he is with the role we've put him in on our team. He's been a top core defenseman for us all season long. He's played some really important minutes for us in key situations, he's still a young kid. He's always dealt with some tough injuries over the last couple years, but he's a determined guy. He works extremely hard. He's got a tremendous work ethic. He's a terrific team guy. He brings a lot to our team. COACH SULLIVAN: It doesn't surprise me that these guys score big goals. They're good players. That's why they're here. They play hard. They play the game the right way. I think they both bring a tremendous amount of speed to our team. They've helped us win games here, not just in the post-season, but down the stretch in the regular season. COACH SULLIVAN: I don't know if it needs it. Obviously, I think our team has a real clear understanding of how we need to play in order to give ourselves the best chance to win. We're trying to play to our strengths, just like other teams that we play against try to do the same. I think our players have a clear understanding at this point. I think there's been enough evidence provided through their play that when we play the game a certain way, and speed is a critical element of it, that we're a pretty good hockey team. COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I certainly have input into call-ups. Ultimately the decision is always Jim Rutherford's. He's our manager and he makes that call. I think Jim does a real good job of utilizing the resources around him to try to help him make the best decision. I did have some input into it. I think the fact that I had the opportunity to coach these guys in Wilkes-Barre, see what they were able to accomplish in the 20-something games that I was down there with them, certainly gave me a clearer indication of how I could utilize them and put them in positions to be successful. So when they did get the opportunity to play in the NHL, I could cast them in the right roles with the right line combinations. These are all areas of Sid's games that I think are his strengths. So to have a guy like Conor to play with him that allows him the opportunity to play that give-and-go game, maybe free up some space or create some space for Sid to make a play, in those types of situations, I think their skill sets are complementary. You never know when you put guys together, will they succeed. Sometimes you think a line combination will work. Sometimes they don't and other times they do. We certainly speak as a coaching staff on a daily basis about our line combinations, which skill sets we think are complementary, who can help whom. We try to use our gut instincts to make the best decisions for our team. Conor has played a fair amount with Sid over the course of the end of the season and into the post-season. We really like what we've seen with that group. I think Sundqvist is another guy that helps those guys as well. He goes to the net. He creates a lot of havoc by going to the net, opening up lanes. He's really good down underneath the hashmarks as far as winning puck battles and helping those guys keep the puck. COACH SULLIVAN: The thought process? First of all, it's in the middle of the game. The coaches aren't really involved in that. We rely on the medical staff to take the necessary steps with our players. That's what they did. I usually get information from our trainer on whether or not a player is available or not available throughout the course of a game. They go through the necessary steps that they need to take with our player. I know that our medical staff does a terrific job as far as taking the right precautionary measures. COACH SULLIVAN: I've spoken to this point on a number of occasions. I don't think he's as good as he is by accident. As long as I've been associated with this league, I don't know that I've been around a player that has the same work ethic as Sid does as far as that insatiable appetite to just try to get better and be the best. I think that's why he's as good as he is. COACH SULLIVAN: I don't question his approach. He's provided so much evidence for us throughout the course of this post-season that he can play and compete in a high-stakes environment. We don't question it. We think Matt gives us the timely saves we need to give the team a chance to win. He did that for us last night. He's done that for us throughout the course of the post-season. He's a big reason why I think this team is still playing to this point. COACH SULLIVAN: That's a lot of hypotheticals for me. Coaches don't really live in that world. If he were to go back on that line, he's a pretty good player. Regardless of which line he plays on, Fehrsy has had the ability to adapt his game. The one thing he does bring to the respective lines, he's another center iceman that can take faceoffs in the defensive zone. He has a real good awareness in the D zone. He's pretty strong on the wall. He brings all of those elements to that line that we choose to put him on. COACH SULLIVAN: We don't want to take penalties just as a rule. But it hurts when our penalty killers that we rely on are in the penalty box. But listen, they're trying to play hard. They're competing. They're trying to do everything they can to help this team win. That's a part of the game. We understand it. Regardless of who takes the penalties, I think we have enough depth in all of our positions that we have enough people that we can put on the ice in a penalty kill situation that we feel comfortable with. Thank you."
2016-05-31,"Martin Jones Joe Pavelski",FALSE,"MARTIN JONES: I mean, just watching him throughout the playoffs, he competes on everything. I think that's the biggest thing you can take away when you watch him play. JOE PAVELSKI: Something like that's never easy. As a teammate, you don't like to see anybody go through that. He handled it professionally. He showed up, played well. He knew it wouldn't be easy. It's one of those areas that you're never prepared for. JOE PAVELSKI: Yeah, I think some of the adjustments, they probably came out a little bit too easy at times. Early on, especially, our turnover rate was probably a little higher than what we're used to. JOE PAVELSKI: It's hard to say if it played a part or not. We were excited to play. We felt we were ready. Then at the start, we didn't execute the way we needed to. We try to take that lesson and learn from it. Hopefully we can have a better start. Obviously it's exciting to be here. I don't know if it's your first time or your fifth time, I'm sure it's exciting every time. JOE PAVELSKI: He's been a great goalie throughout these playoffs. He's done well. We've seen some really good goalies along the way so far. It's about getting traffic, getting shots. We need a few more attempts early on, test him, not let him get settled in, the way he was last night. If you can get shots, get free around the net, we got a few rebounds. JOE PAVELSKI: You try to have a plan on faceoffs to try to execute off them. It's one of those areas, it's nice when you have the puck. You start with it. You can get moving. There's maybe certain areas when you win them, you're able to get on the forecheck or breakout a little bit easier. When you don't win them, you don't throw the towel in. I think that's the biggest thing. JOE PAVELSKI: I don't know. They did a pretty good job I think at times. We didn't have a whole lot of space out there. We didn't create a whole lot of zone time where we just kept rolling around. Every game's a little different. I found myself carrying the puck into the zone a few times. Whether delaying there or not, or passing it over. I had one chance coming in the second. A little traffic, but he sees it from far out. You don't really expect that to go in too often. One chance around the net. Couple areas try to get some tips. MARTIN JONES: No. I think maybe just the sense of urgency. You never want to go down 2-0 in a series. Whether you lose the first game, any game, you never want to lose two in a row in playoffs. MARTIN JONES: Yeah, he was right on his tail. I was just trying to make the best read I could. Burnsy made a great play."
2016-05-31,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: I think when you look at our regular-season faceoff percentage, we're a pretty good team. Part of it is opponents. You play the L.A. Kings, Nashville, St.Louis, you're playing very good faceoff teams. I think that plays a part of it. COACH DeBOER: I think he's excellent defensively. The answer to that is not many can catch him. He might have got Hagelin at the end of a shift, because I'm not even sure flat out if he could. It shows you what an athlete Burnsy is and the speed he's got. Defensively, he's been excellent all year. I had this guy at the World Championships last year, best defenseman of the tournament both ends of the ice. I've seen that all year from him. There's been no issue defensively. COACH DeBOER: It's no different than most of the teams in the league. There's nothing there we haven't seen before. The game is on us. It's on us to execute better. It's on us to impose our game on them for longer stretches. COACH DeBOER: Two parts. No, and everybody. I want everybody to get more shots. No, we weren't happy with the number of shots. We weren't happy with the quality of shots. We weren't happy with the guys who didn't get enough shots. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, well, it's a tough situation. To Justin's credit, he was business as usual. He's made some arrangements for after Game2 to pay his respects and do what he has to do on that end. COACH DeBOER: Anytime you have a guy like Nieto available, which he just recently got available to us, he's always a consideration. We'll sleep on that and come up with some decisions tomorrow morning. Thank you."
2016-05-30,"Mike Sullivan",TRUE,"COACH SULLIVAN: Well, I think he's a terrific player in every aspect of the game. We use him in so many key situations, both offensively and defensively. He's brave. He blocks shots. He's one of our better shot-blockers. He's a good faceoff guy. He's done so much for this team to help us get to this point. COACH SULLIVAN: I think part of it is human nature. I think there's a few things that play. You have to give the opponent credit. They're going to push, too, raise their intensity. I think that's part of it. But I also think sometimes it starts with our decisions with the puck. I thought early in the second period we turned the puck over a few times. We really didn't have a lot of ice to play on. We had opportunities to put pucks behind them. We chose to try to play in front of them instead of behind them. I think when we're at our best, we make the right decisions in the neutral zone, that area of the rink. I think there's a few dynamics at play. But certainly I think our players are well aware of how we have to play in order to play to our strengths and our identity. Speed is always a part of it, where we put our opponents under pressure, whether we have the puck or don't have the puck. Sometimes you're better off not having the puck, putting your opponents under pressure when they have to make a play under a lot of duress. You can create offense that way, as well. COACH SULLIVAN: Matt is a versatile guy, too. We've used him up and down the lineup all year. He can play center. He can play wing. He can play either wing, the left side or the right side. He's a real smart player. He's good at both ends of the rink. When he plays with Geno, it's another center iceman on the ice, if he has to take a faceoff. To have two center icemen on the ice, especially late in the game when you're defending a lead, I think that gives us more of a comfort level. COACH SULLIVAN: Yeah, you could see his hunger to win. He's inspiring. I thought he was a force out there all night. He's so strong on the puck. His speed through the neutral zone. He's a threat. Every time he jumps over the boards, we feel like he's a threat to score, just a threat as far as putting pressure on our opponent's defense. COACH SULLIVAN: Sure, I do. We certainly didn't want to go into this series with a wait-and-see approach. We didn't want to go through a feeling-out process. We wanted to try to go out and dictate the terms right away. I think that's when we play our best, when we're on our toes and we skate. So we try to do it in a calculated way. When I use the term 'fearless,' I think that word encompasses a lot of things. Most specifically, it's not just, Let's not get overwhelmed by the circumstance, let's not have any sort of anxiety when we go out there because the stakes are high, let's just go and embrace the moment and challenge each other to be the best and have fun with this. COACH SULLIVAN: They've been a big part of this team for so long now. It doesn't surprise us. These guys are good hockey players. They add another element to our team. The energy that they bring, the enthusiasm that they bring to the rink. They've stepped up and made some big plays for us, not just scoring goals. Conor gets a big goal tonight. I thought he was real good. He was on the puck. He was quick. I thought he played that give-and-go game with Sid. When he plays that way, he's a real good player. Rusty, I think his speed is so evident out there. His pursuit on the forecheck. Scores another big goal for us. But the other young guys as well. Tommy Kuhnhackl had a couple big shots, strong on the wall. As I said all along, we have a nice chemistry of veteran players and young guys here that complement one another. I think they really enjoy one another. COACH SULLIVAN: He's a real calm, cool and collected guy. I don't think his heart rate gets too high. He just goes about his job. I think he's great with his linemates. He's great with the young players. He's a reassuring presence both in the locker room and on the bench. COACH SULLIVAN: We like how they complement one another. Cullsy is more a stay-at-home guy, big body, strong in front of the net, strong shot-blocker, he can play in the trenches. Justin is a puck mover. He gets involved in the rush, gets back to pucks quickly, helps us get out of our end zone. He has a real good shot on the blueline. We think since we've had them together, they tend to complement one another fairly well. They played some important minutes for us in key situations. I think our defense corps as a group, as a whole, have really stepped up for our team. These guys are playing as good as they can play or as good as I've seen them play since I've been here, all of them as a group of six. That particular pair, I think especially since Trevor Daley got hurt, has really stepped up for the group as far as helping us win. Thank you."
2016-05-30,"Kris Letang Mike Sullivan",FALSE,"KRIS LETANG: Yeah, it's a little bit different in that regard. Especially ice time situation I have to play in. But if I look at it as a group, it's a little bit similar. We had new addition that kind of boost our lineup, we had a coaching change during the year. It give us a spark. Going there, we climbed a hard road. We faced a big rivalry team in the playoff. We had to face the Flyers when we won in '09, too. KRIS LETANG: I think it's more of a five-man unit out there. When we play defense, everybody plays together, all five guys. All the forwards help out. Every time you step in, doesn't matter, you know your job, you know you got the support of different guys on the ice. KRIS LETANG: He's an unbelievable D. Hedman was, too. I just focus on my game. My game is different. His game is different. KRIS LETANG: We have a good group of guys, guys that want to hang out together all the time. Sometimes you have groups that tend to be separated in different groups. But these guys, we got Phil, he wants to hang out with everybody, wants to have fun. It kind of brings everybody together when you have a guy that played that many games in the league. As a team, for the rest, the speed of our team is just like we know that's our advantage. That's what we have to use. When we play into our system, that's why we get successful. Yeah, that's what's special about it. COACH SULLIVAN: I'm not sure that team would make it this far. I do have memorabilia from that team. Obviously it was my first NHL experience playing. Those were always fond memories for a player, their first experience in the league. I have a fair amount of memorabilia from that team. Banners, pucks, my first goal, a signed autographed framed picture, team photo, things of that nature. What I remember most about the Cow Palace is if you had the fortunate privilege to have the last shift of the period, then you had to walk up those stairs, it was like the green mile. I think they had to put chairs down at the bottom to give that last shift a chance to rest before they had to climb up the stairs to the locker room. COACH SULLIVAN: Sure. Phil and I have had a number of conversations over the course of the season. I was trying to define for him what our expectations are, how we might think he could best help us win. Phil has been very receptive all year long. I think he's made great strides over the last couple of months in some of the areas of his game where we've asked him to improve and get better. I think he's made a commitment to play away from the puck. I think he's playing much smarter in his own end zone. I think his offense speaks for itself. We try to stay out of his way when he has the puck. He certainly has way better instincts than the coaching staff does. That's what makes him the elite player that he is. We tried to challenge him in his game away from the puck, trying to become the two-way player that is so necessary to help us win playoff games. Phil, to his credit, has been very receptive. COACH SULLIVAN: It doesn't really change. The coaching staff just spends more time trying to familiarize ourselves with their tendencies, their personnel, their team concept, how they play. But as far as the process is concerned, that really doesn't change. We'll certainly prepare our team for our opponent, what we're up against. As I've always said here all along, our main priority, our main goal has always been on our own team, trying to play the game a certain way. So we spend a lot of time watching ourselves, areas of our game where we can improve, get better, reinforcing areas where we have success. So that's always been the main focus of this coaching staff with our team. COACH SULLIVAN: I agree with him. I think his best is yet to come, too. He's a tremendous player. As that series went on, he started to play more of a straight-ahead game. He played a north game. When he plays that way, he's really tough to challenge. When he challenging opponents with his speed and his power, obviously his puck skills are evident. But his speed and his power I think is really tough to handle. COACH SULLIVAN: Certainly our discipline is going to be important. I think it was in the last series. We faced some pretty good power plays throughout the course of these playoffs. So San Jose is another one of those teams that has a very good power play. Our discipline has to be there for us, as it has been throughout the course of the playoffs. I trust our guys in that regard. Certainly they're a tough power play to defend because they have a lot of movement and they have a lot of threats. It's difficult to key on any one guy because they have so many different threats. I think what we have to do is continue to understand why our penalty kill is successful, the pressure points and areas where we can put that power play under pressure and force them to have to make plays under duress. I think that's going to be an important aspect of our penalty kill. COACH SULLIVAN: I don't think so. I think our ability to get back to pucks quickly, move the puck quickly, is one of the advantages, one of the strengths that we have. I think we have a very courageous defense group. They go back for pucks, they take hits when they have to to make plays. That's an important element of our team concept in coming out of our end zone. I think it's just the nature of today's game. It's difficult to provide any sort of interference for a forecheck. So defensemen have to take hits. I think we've got a very brave group. They go back for pucks, they take hits to make plays. I think their mobility a lot of times gives them an ability to avoid body checks or only get a partial check and not have to bear the brunt of the full force. When we pass and move, I think that's when we're at our best. But, you know, when we put Rusty on that right side with Geno and Kuny, we like the line. We thought it had a lot of speed. We thought they were hard to play against. Rusty and Kuny are very responsible players at both ends of the rink. I think they can track pucks down and pursue pucks and help Geno get the puck back. He obviously is one of the premier play-makers in the league and just a great offensive player. That line we liked over the last few games. They've really provided a lot of offense for us, but also provided some stability in our D zone as well just because of the skill sets that we think are complementary. COACH SULLIVAN: Very confident."
2016-05-30,"Peter DeBoer",TRUE,"COACH DeBOER: I think the first period was a product, credit to them, they came out and were moving, like you would expect if you were playing at home in the first game of the Stanley Cup Final. We stood around and watched a little bit. Didn't get up to speed, didn't get up to pace. I really liked our second period. We started to play the way we're capable of playing. And the third, you know, we didn't play like we did in the second for long enough stretches. We had some spurts here and there. But they played their game for longer stretches than we did tonight. COACH DeBOER: Well, no adjustments other than getting to play our game. We didn't play our game in the first period. We stood around and watched. They're a fast team. They dictated play in the first. I thought when we played our game in the second, they had trouble with us. COACH DeBOER: I don't know. You know guys are dialed in, they want to play well. Everyone's heart is in the right place. It's something. Is it us traveling? Emotional letdown after the last game? COACH DeBOER: We'll look at the game tape. There's nothing that I saw tonight that I'm going out of here thinking that we can't come out and compete and play much better on our end. COACH DeBOER: Yeah, goalie was good. Goalie was good. Thank you."
2016-05-30,"Peter DeBoer",FALSE,"COACH DeBOER: There's a lot smarter people than me out there to figure out whether it's a trend. But it is pretty incredible. You got two guys with the experience these two guys have. I think they're special. I don't think it's a common thing. I don't think you're going to see it yearly. I think it's rare. But there's been many instances in the history of hockey where a young goaltender has led a team to a Stanley Cup. I think it's all belief. When our guys go in the room and talk to Marty Jones or play in front of him, they're not looking at him like he's a rookie or a 22-year-old or a guy that's played only so many games. They look at him like he's a seasoned veteran because he carries himself that way. COACH DeBOER: No, I don't think so. Again, I think our approach all along has been business as usual. I think the guys have realized as we got through the L.A. series, as we got through Nashville, Game 7, as we got through a really tough St.Louis team, even at the different points of adversity facing elimination against Nashville, we didn't change. There was no magic speeches. There was no big line combination changes or roster changes or changes to our system. COACH DeBOER: There's a sense. I talked about it yesterday. First year in the community, I didn't realize kind of the baggage that was carried around, 25-year season ticketholders coming up to you with tears in their eyes and crying. There were some moments there after where the gravity of what they've been through and how important this is to them. But again, those things are for later. The business at hand now is to get off on the right foot, plant the right seeds for this series, impose our game. COACH DeBOER: Well, or injuries. Nieto came out because of an injury. Wingels jumped in, did a great job. Nieto is healthy, we've got decisions to make. We have a nice mix of guys down there that bring different things. Zubrus is a big-body guy that plays a real heavy game that's effective this time of year. Nieto is a speed guy. Wingels is an agitator and a guy that finishes every hit, hard to play against. Spaling does his thing. COACH DeBOER: Paul's great. He's so understated as a player. His personality is the same, but there's so much substance to his play and as a person. I can't tell you how important he's been, one, on the ice, working with Brent Burns, his veteran leadership, his composure. And two, just the way he carries himself around the room. He's a classy guy. He's a lot of fun to be around. He's fit in seamlessly with our group. We wouldn't be here without him. COACH DeBOER: Thank you."
2016-05-30,"Nick Bonino Carl Hagelin",TRUE,"NICK BONINO: Yeah, just came into the zone a little bit late. I saw Tanger in the corner. Haggy was down there battling with him. Wasn't sure if I should get out of there and get above their guys. They kept alive and Tanger put it right on my stick. NICK BONINO: I don't know about long-term, you never know. Especially me, the last few summers. CARL HAGELIN: It was obviously cool to be out there. There was a lot of energy in the building. It was super loud. Any time you can kill off a penalty that late, it's a really good feeling. I think we did a good job of not giving them any shots. CARL HAGELIN: Yeah, it was a fast-paced game for sure. Two teams that came out with a lot of intensity. We skated really hard in the first obviously. They kind of caught up to us in the second when we stopped skating a little bit. NICK BONINO: I think the biggest thing for me is to stay even-keeled, not change my game, whether it's game one of the season or the Stanley Cup Final. I think that allows me to kind of stay in the moment there. When you get passes like I've gotten, pucks to the net like Haggy did, the pass tonight from Tanger, it makes it a whole lot easier to score those goals."
